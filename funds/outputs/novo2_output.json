Our group at Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen in collaboration with Novo Nordisk A/S has developed different antibody assays to monitor the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. We now want to perform an in-depth investigation of which SARS-CoV-2 antigens the immune response is directed against. Additionally, we want to investigate what types of antibodies that are generated during the infection, including their affinity and avidity and whether the antibodies indeed are protective or not. This type of knowledge will enable a better understanding of the duration of a SARS-Cov-2 antibody response and if the antibodies provide immunity against the virus. This information can also help the authorities to understand how widespread the SAR-Cov-2 infection is in the society and could help support the development of new treatment and vaccine strategies against COVID-19.",

Until the establishment of the PCR facilities, tests in Greenland have been sent to Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, but this poses a major challenge, both financially and in terms of the time factor. And in the event of an actual outbreak in Greenland, it may become critical, given the need for speedy test results to avoid a build-up of patients whose status is unresolved and who therefore need to be kept in isolation.",

This is achieved by continually collecting local data concerning the spread of the virus and comparing it with data on the capacity of local hospitals. Also, real-time data from electronic patient records will be obtained for COVID-19 patients who are admitted to hospital, which will help to identify the severely ill and the less seriously ill patients and provide suggestions for treatment based on clinical recommendations. Through Artificial Intelligence, the data will be used to pinpoint the most important factors contributing to severe illness. Based on this, it will be possible to generate updated risk assessments for the individual patients, from their admission and onwards.",

All patients who are referred to North Denmark Regional Hospital and the Children’s Ward at Aalborg University Hospital will – in addition to receiving a throat swab – be screened for virus through a rectal swab. Furthermore, the project will monitor all admitted patients to find out for how long coronavirus is secreted through the respiratory passages as well as rectally. The project will also examine if rectal swabs can be used to reduce the number of false-negative test results and thereby minimize the risk of placing COVID-19 patients in open wards rather than isolating them.",

The project will elucidate this based on nationwide registry data. It will analyse what characterizes people with diabetes who test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk factors for serious complications and death among people hospitalized with COVID-19.

Moreover, there is uncertainty about the extent to which and for how long COVID-19 is transmissible from deceased persons, which is particularly relevant for personnel handling the deceased. In this project, tests will be carried out where fresh samples from living as well as deceased COVID-19 patients are transferred to lab-grown human cells. By observing the cells and taking measurements, it can be established whether the samples contain a transmissible virus. The expectation is that the project will give a more precise picture of the contagion risk in connection with this virus, and thus contribute to formulating effective guidelines for reducing the spread of the disease.",

The hope is that such models can be used by frontline staff when dealing with new COVID-19 patients as well as by planners in the health service. In addition, the project will seek to identify patterns in the patient data that may form the basis for new recommendations on how best to treat COVID-19 patients in the future.

    "title": "Establishment of temporary emergency shelter and soup kitchen for socially marginalized citizens in the city of Aarhus",
    "summary": "The purpose of the project is to provide emergency accommodation and meals for the most vulnerable citizens in Aarhus. The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions on social gatherings have had a dramatic effect on the living conditions for Aarhus’ socially marginalized citizens. Existing shelters have had to reduce their capacity, while some drop-in centres have closed altogether. Due to the risk of infection and the implemented restrictions on social gatherings, there is shortage of emergency accommodation and provision of meals under the current circumstances. To address this situation, the project will establish a temporary emergency shelter and a soup kitchen in Aarhus. The project is run by a consortium consisting of Danish Red Cross, DanChurchSocial, Blue Cross Denmark and The Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Denmark (Folkekirken).",

    "summary": "The purpose of the project is to uncover the psychological consequences of COVID-19. It is commonly known that during epidemics, there may be a rise in the occurrence of negative psychological reactions, observable among half of the exposed population. Through an interview survey, the project will examine people’s experience of being at risk of COVID-19, of being infected with the disease, as well as how it feels to have a next of kin who is seriously ill or who dies as a result of COVID-19. The project will describe the psychological reactions among patients and their next of kin and propose measures for mitigating the psychological consequences.",
