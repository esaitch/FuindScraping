    "title": "EarthHologenomics: unveiling global patterns of gut microbiome-animal interactions in light of environmental variation",
    "summary": "What\n\nIn EarthHologenomics we will perform the first global mapping of spatial variation of animal-microbiome interactions. We will screen climatic, habitat and dietary gradients in 50 widespread animal taxa spanning the four main vertebrate clades (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians) to identify general patterns across animal phylogeny and geographic space. We will leverage the network of over 120 researchers that are already collecting samples within the Earth Hologenome Initiative. We will employ whole genome sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to characterise genomic features of animal hosts and associated gut microbial communities. This will enable us not only to perform taxonomic inferences, but to understand the functional capabilities of animal genomes and microbial metagenomes.\n\nWhy\n\nResearch carried out in the last decade has unveiled that biology of animals is largely impacted by microorganism associated with them. However, the global impact of such interactions in animal ecology and evolution has not been quantified yet. The data we will generate in EarthHologenomics will enable us to address questions such as how animal genomes and microbial metagenomes interact to provide adaptive capacity of animals towards climate change, or why genomically related species often exhibit contrasting geographic range sizes. In addition, the metagenomic characterisation of wild animals will allow us to screen for zoonotic diseases with an unparalleled resolution, while the large catalogue of bacterial genomes we will generate will enable identifying potential probiotic strains.\n\nHow\n\nEarthHologenomics will leverage the Earth Hologenome Initiative, a global endeavour founded and coordinated by the PI, which will provide access to the largest catalogue of faecal, oral, blood and tissue samples of over 120 vertebrate taxa from all over the world. We will select 50 widespread animal species, and collect samples to generate paired genomic and metagenomic datasets across environmental gradients. These data will include whole-genome genotypes of animal hosts, and high quality genome reconstructions of associated bacteria. Data analysis will be conducted using a range of phylogenomic, spatial and community ecology tools to unveil relationships between microbial and animal genomic properties and their association with environmental features, among others.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project will provide precious information for mapping zoonotic diseases, identifying potential probiotic strains, and understanding how animals adapt to climate change through their genomes and associated microorganisms' metagenomes.",

    "title": "Understanding the mechanisms of gender disparity in financial choices",
    "summary": "What\n\nGender disparity has been documented in households' liability management (e.g., use of expensive credit facilities and delay or omission of advantageous refinancing) as well as asset allocation (e.g., non-participation in stock markets and lack of portfolio diversification). Both the welfare and individual cost of these financial mistakes are substantial. Our project seeks to identify through which mechanisms financial mistakes are made, and the characteristics to explain the behavior of individuals and households, and where the gender disparity arises.\n\nWhy\n\nPrevious studies estimating deep preference parameters of importance for policy are usually assessed without explaining individuals' underlying heterogeneity - and reported as conditional means. This implicitly assumes that one policy tool works the same for all individuals, irrespective of gender. Our project aims to solve this shortcoming and enable us to identify and describe a more realistic mechanism of choices - and understand how policy interventions can be designed and targeted at the type of individuals for which it is relevant.\n\nHow\n\nThe econometric methods developed to uncover deep parameters of interest at the individual level are built on simulation of distributions, optimization at the individual level, and the calculation of many-dimensional matrixes when characterizing network effects. Usually, these models are built and executed for samples over a few thousand observations. As our research projects are modeling behavior over several million individuals over long periods, we need substantial computational power to handle algorithms' complexity. The grant provides the computational ability to execute these methods on large samples.\n\nSSR\n\nFemales are, on average, reported to pay higher interest rates on loans. Is this gender disparity\nexplained by discrimination or by choices? Understanding mechanisms of discrimination are of the\nessence to have the ability to design policies to reduce discrimination. The current project proposal\nwill provide novel insights of interest to academia, market participants, and policymakers to design more social responsible and fair financial markets.",

During the live streaming the citizens can discuss and process the impressions they gain at the lectures with each other.\nThe project creates activity and 'communities of science' in both smaller and larger communities in many different geographical areas. It is the project's aim to reach every citizen, regardless of their academic qualifications - from the oldest students in secondary school to skilled workers and professors. For the same reason, the lectures are most often lectured in Danish.\n\nHow\n\nIn this project, we will work on signing agreements regarding live streaming in more locations in the geographical areas of Denmark, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Germany that have yet to be represented, so their citizens will have the opportunity to experience the lectures.

    "summary": "What\n\nA two-day conference bringing together a number of internationally recognized scholars in order to discuss the development of social inequality in prehistoric societies using a diverse range of methodologies.\n\nWhy\n\nWhile the origins of social inequality are rooted deep in the human past, the point at which these first began to materialize is the subject of much debate. The development of settled agriculture, which began over 12,000 years ago in Southwest Asia, is commonly seen as the main driver for the emergence of societies structured upon the differential distribution of resources. There is now increasing evidence, however, that various forms of social differentiation existed well before the emergence of fully sedentary agricultural societies.\r\n\r\nArchaeologists must reconsider how we define and study social inequality by considering the specific circumstances under which early societies with fluid and flexible forms of social differentiation are transformed into hierarchical nation states.\n\nHow\n\nWe have invited six internationally recognized researchers who specialize in social inequality in prehistoric Europe and Southwest Asia. Each will give an hour-long presentation on their research, followed by roundtable discussions between the speakers and other conference participants over a two-day period. Each speaker will explore the conference themes via a number of material correlates traditionally associated with social inequality in the archaeological record between the Upper Paleolithic and Early Bronze Age, e.g. funerary practices, resource abundance, demography and settlement patterns.\n\nSSR\n\nGiven the increasing levels of inequality in modern Western societies, the discussions and subsequent publications generated from this conference will be of great interest to the wider public.",

    "title": "LANDSCAPE OF THE GODS - the sacral topography of Bornholm in the first millennium AD",
    "summary": "What\n\nBefore the 1980s, the Old Norse gods were mainly known from myths written down in the Middle Ages. In later decades, archaeological discoveries throughout Scandinavia have revealed evidence of the practices of this pre-Christian religion: there were small, local traditions as well as large communal sacrificial feasts. The cult took place in both remote and central places, in special cult buildings and in the open landscape. \n\nThis project is a comprehensive study of religious activities and places on the island of Bornholm in the first millennium AD. It explores relations between levels of the cult in the topographical and social landscape, seeking to identify dynamics behind religious change and the position of Bornholm in pan-Scandinavian religious networks.\n\nWhy\n\nWe have only begun to understand how Old Norse religion actually worked. Bornholm, as a well-defined geographical unit with an exceptional density of well-documented archaeological locations, offers a unique possibility to investigate pre-Christian sacral topography in detail. The island was a hub of trade and contacts in the Baltic Sea and several sites have evidence of pre-Christian cultic activity. Important examples are the rich settlement Sorte Muld near Svaneke and a place name such as Gudhjem, 'home of the Gods'.\n\nIn a global perspective, the study of Bornholm through the first millennium offers insights into the long-term dynamics of a small island community and further contributes to large scale descriptions of historical tendencies in settlement and social  organisation.\n\nHow\n\nThe project consists of a detailed interdisciplinary analysis of place names, archaeology and landscape on Bornholm in the first millennium AD. For this purpose, a revision and digital mapping of toponomy and archaeological sites related to pre-Christian religion is created. Topographical information is extracted from aerial photos, LIDAR-scans and historical maps. The project takes part in archaeological field work at Sorte Muld and performs georadar analyses of the sites Smørenge and Agerbygård. Based on these investigations, the project uncovers interplays between social organisation and sacral topography, and explores the role of these interplays in developments at local and supra-regional levels. The results are then discussed in relation to other sacral environments in Scandinavia.\n\nSSR\n\nIn a world of digital distractions, it is ever more important to lift our gaze and look at the landscapes around us. In times of change, connecting with a deeper historical perspective can provide a sense of anchoring and order. Threads reaching far back in a forgotten time are continuously activated through our movements in the landscape and use of old place names in our everyday language. \n\nThis project is about these ancient elements, visible as well as hidden in the physical and linguistic landscape. These traces will not only be investigated, but also made accessible to the local population, visitors to Bornholm and people all over the world with an interest in Old Norse religion. \nWork on archaeological and onomastic landscapes at its best happens in close interaction with local volunteer groups and companies and there is a strong tradition on Bornholm for engagement in local history. The project will also contribute the ongoing work of Bornholm's Museum on building sustainable heritage tourism in the Baltic Region.\nIn a wider perspective, the study adds to a deeper understanding of local and global issues in times of change, and adds perspectives on how change in the past may point towards what will happen in the future.",

    "title": "Algorithmic Decision Making: Philosophical Challenges",
    "summary": "What\n\nGenerally, the project asks how the widespread inclusion of machine-learning algorithms in society will affect decision making. On the one hand, there is reason to expect that such algorithms in many data heavy contexts soon will be more reliable and accurate than even human experts. Yet, on the other hand, such algorithms often work as intransparent \"black-boxes\": they correlate reliably and accurately specific inputs with specific outputs, but we have no idea ​why and how they do it. So we face a serious trade-off: ​​by aligning our decision making with algorithms, we increase accuracy and reliability, but in virtue of their intransparency, we risk sacrificing informed decision making in the process. The projects investigates the theoretical and practical implications of this trade-off.\n\nWhy\n\nThe trade-off between algorithmic accuracy and transparency has recently gained much attention in both philosophy and AI. The current project is important scientifically because it promises to make these two-largely insulated-research strands speak together. To illustrate, consider the rapidly growing field of 'Explainable AI', which, as a research area, aims to develop systems that can 'explain' the internal workings of black-box algorithms. Many systems are currently being developed but none has so far gained serious traction. In part because it is unclear which explanations we want from algorithms, and in part because it is unclear which explanations they can offer. By consulting the vast philosophical literature on explanation, there is hope we can make progress on these issues.\n\nHow\n\nWhile the core research in the project is non-empirical, there will be expertise in the research group to extract and explain the technical AI literature on machine-learning algorithms. By combining this technical knowledge with the conceptual rigour and interpretative potential of philosophical thinking, we can critically assess how-and to what extent-the inclusion of complex algorithms will affect decision making in various societal contexts. Although it is not the aim of the project to explain how we ought to navigate the trade-off between algorithmic accuracy and transparency, there is hope that our work can help facilitate such normative considerations.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project promises to give us a much richer unde​rstanding of the complex relationship between transparency and accuracy in algorithmic decision making. The hope is that this richer understanding will help inform us not only about choices of technological solutions in AI, but also about the impact that algorithms can have on core human values such as trust in concrete societal contexts. By now, algorithms are (increasingly) found in all parts of society: from analyses of customer behavior to diagnostic tools in healthcare. So a project devoted to a careful analysis of the type of decision making that algorithms promote is thus important in most social contexts.",

    "title": "Balancing Business Model Innovation",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe study of business model innovation has become very popular in the strategy and innovation literatures. My research examines the links between business models and cognition. Business models can be studied as a form of cognitive structure, mental map, or schema of how the firm creates value. My research has highlighted how managers’ cognitions and sensemaking influence business model design and the role of shared logics in enabling such innovation. The information and knowledge search behaviour of managers, and perceptual differences between groups of managers in the same firm, thus affects the type of BMI being pursued. With this project it is planned to visit colleagues at UC Berkeley and Stanford University, to collect data on relevant firms in the Silicon Vallley.\n\nWhy\n\nEstablished firms must balance the resources devoted on the one hand to the optimization of existing products, processes, and structures, and on the other to innovation, including business model innovation. The cognitive perspective on such innovation offers a useful explanatory mechanism for why such innovation often fails. What managers perceive to be important affects this balance. But what if managers have incorrect perceptions? Specifically, what if managers misperceive changes taking place in the external environment? Or if they perceive things differently? This can help explain under what conditions established firms are more or less likely to be successful in innovation their business models.\r\nArchaeologists must reconsider how we define and study social inequality by considering the specific circumstances under which early societies with fluid and flexible forms of social differentiation are transformed into hierarchical nation states.\n\nHow\n\nIt is the plan to conduct a single visit to both UC Berkeley and Stanford University in fall 2021. During this visit I will be discussing the theoretical foundations and practical examples of a cognitive view on incumbent business model innovation, based on the idea that decision-makers in this context can have either a high or low degree of knowledge calibration regarding industry change. In the case of miscalibration (i.e. incorrect perceptions), my theory would be that firms might incorrectly balance their resources towards either (innovation) exploration or (optimization) exploitation. The exact practical implications of this remain to be explored, and this is one of the things I hope to explore by collecting data on relevant firms in the Silicon Valley area.\n\nSSR\n\nIn order to solve the grand challenges of our time, innovation is often identified as a key human activity. It is through the adoption of more sustainable business models, as well as the development of new technical solutions, that humanity is going to succeed in reducing greenhouse emmissions and pollution, while continuing to reduce poverty. The learnings of my work on business model innovation from the cognitive perspective can be easily applied to the context of sustainable business models.",

    "summary": "What\n\nSand is the most mined material in the world and a key ingredient in modern life. Aggregates - sand and gravel - are being extracted faster than they can be replaced, yet the critical value of these natural resources have received distressingly little attention. \n\nThis project aims to understand the implications sand mining has on ecosystems, human health and societies while also acknowledging the value of this critical commodity for economies and communities around the world. In particular, the project will assess the conflicts and synergies that arise from sand mining in Africa with the United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWhy\n\nThe global population is roughly 8 billion and the African continent is expected to increase its population from 1 billion to 2.4 billion by 2050. A key ingredient in our modern world is sand, which constitutes the foundation for modern civilization. However, various complications arise from the lack of understanding of sand's importance. We currently have little knowledge of the links between sand mining and disease prevention, nor do we have sufficient insight into the relationship between mining activities and urbanization, population growth and bio-sensitive areas.\r\n\r\nThis project will gain new insights into these complex relationships that exist to sustainably manage and govern this essential natural resource while sustainably develop and improve the livelihood for people in Africa.\n\nHow\n\nThe project analyzes where the resources are exploited in Africa and project the spatial demand for sand on the increasingly populated continent. Using a machine learning approach, I will produce a map showing sand mining activities in Africa. Hereafter, I will assess the spatial overlap of housing improvement in Africa over the past decade and compare with sand mining \"hot spots\" identified in the map. \nLastly, I will assess complex conflicts and synergies of sand mining with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Ultimately, gaining a better understanding will help guide further efforts to minimize the negative effects on the environment and set the way towards creating a comprehensive assessment of the relationships between sand mining, poverty reduction and livelihood improvement.\n\nSSR\n\nWhile the project is founded on basic research on landscape changes, it has high societal relevance as it shines light on the overlooked global challenge of natural resource scarcity. It focuses on the extensive usage and dependency of the world's most mined mineral as well as the complexity in managing the resource in an increasingly populated world. \n\nThe goal of the project is to draw international attention to the natural resource challenge and to document the complexity in achieving a sustainable usage of this natural resource while sustainably improving conditions for the world's poorest and most marginalized regions.\n\nThe project aims to be the transformational step needed to boost and initiate collaborations between research, industry, local communities and policy-makers.",

    "title": "Politics that matters. Materiality and the Body Politic 1500-1800",
    "summary": "What\n\nPolitical thinkers of the past have always thought about the meaning of matter and about the flesh of bodies. They have written about the bodies of kings and of citizens, about the anatomy of subjects and foreigners, about sex, birth, and death. They have meditated on the matter of life: on food, waste, on earth and mud, on clothes, trinkets, and other 'things', and have called this 'the stuff of the state'. The body politic itself (what we today would understand as 'the state'), strange as it might seem to us today, was seen as an embodied being, which had to go through its own life cycle, its own illnesses, and for which the political thinker needed to find remedies as medicine. The book will show the centrality of these reflections for the early modern world.\n\nWhy\n\nIn contrast to other historical disciplines, the history of political ideas has yet to have a material or a bodily turn. Motivated by the quest to understand how our modern abstract\nidea of 'the state' came into being, historians of political thought have not fully explored this other, seemingly 'medieval' side to early modern political thought. My monograph will change and innovate this and show that reflections on materiality and bodies 'built' the modern state and its theory. The book will also show that early modern thinking was global by nature. It will contextualise\npolitical treaties with those travel accounts European thinkers were reading avidly, and so show that foreign bodies (of states and of people) mattered decisively for the early\nunderstanding of the state.\n\nHow\n\nThrough a re-reading of a large source corpus of the most important political writers of their time, contextualised\nwith contemporary knowledge on medicine, the monograph will show that many seemingly abstract concepts, like liberty, justice, civic virtue, and 'the state' itself were\nalways conceived as concrete and with a view to material and embodied realities.\n\nSSR\n\nThe monograph will contribute to our knowledge about the paths taken and the paths neglected on the way to the states and societies in which we are living today. We are now in an era of pandemics and climate change, in which political theory and political action need to take the material foundations of life, and the health of states and their citizens, seriously. The book will help to show the lineage of this kind of thinking and it so excavates the historical foundations of our modern approaches to politics.",

    "title": "Untied Kingdom: A World History of the End of Britain",
    "summary": "What\n\nRecent developments in UK politics have reignited debates about Scottish and Welsh separatism, and the enduring tensions over the Northern Ireland border, as the polarised politics of Brexit have left a legacy of speculation about an impending ‘Break-Up of Britain’. This project examines the deeper historical antecedents, taking in the wider perspective of the end of the British Empire. To what extent can the eclipse of unifying British symbols and sentiments be understood in terms of a failure of British identities to resonate globally since the Second World War? The question invites a global approach, taking in perspectives from Australia, Canada, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe (and the ‘four nations’ of the United Kingdom itself).\n\nWhy\n\nFor more than fifty years, historians and social scientists have identified possible links between the contraction of Britain’s empire and the fragile unity of the UK, with scholars of diverse leanings lending support to the idea: from J. G. A Pocock to Tom Nairn, Raphael Samuel, Linda Colley, Krishan Kumar, Norman Davies, and David Marquand. Yet remarkably, the link between imperial collapse abroad and post-imperial corrosion ‘at home’ has never been developed beyond a crude proposition, and remains remarkably under-researched. This book offers the first comprehensive analysis based on extensive empirical research, with a view to reconceptualizing the problem by integrating metropolitan and imperial perspectives.\n\nHow\n\nThe book is both a synthesis of a large and unwieldy subject as well as a novel empirical study in its own right, forging linkages between multiple crises of British selfhood at empire’s end. Rather than account for every manifestation in every corner of the globe, distinct choices have been made in terms of chronological, geographical and thematic emphasis, structured around the key registers of transcontinental British community that buckled under the pressures of post-war decolonization. The empirical material has been selected accordingly, taking in archive and manuscript collections in more than ten countries. The book’s thirteen chapters cumulatively build an argument based on connections and comparisons drawn between changing community sentiments in multiple hemispheres.\n\nSSR\n\nThis is a project where the immediate social and political repercussions are yet to be fully played out. The ‘Break-Up of Britain’ remains a polemical as much as a scholarly proposition, and much prior research has inevitably been dominated by partisan perspectives. The wider remit of this project draws the focus away from unresolved present-day disputes to consider instead the historical conditions that produced these divisions to begin with. Examining the problem in other parts of the world where Britishness now exists only in the past tense also offers an invaluable (and arguably sobering) perspective that is usually absent from separatist political debates in the UK. There is thus unique potential here to inform these debates, without necessarily making a direct political intervention.",

    "summary": "What\n\nJust four decades ago, Danish women automatically got their husband's surname when getting married. Now, 25% of surname changes are done by men, just like it has become possible for unmarried couples to share a surname, for divorcees to pass on a former spouse's surname to a new partner, etc. So, which functions do surnames serve in family practices and identity formation today? In this project, I will examine the role of surnames as part of family practices, name choices' role in identity formation and the reasons why some surnames are chosen over others. To put the Danish development into perspective, differences in perceptions of surname use between Denmark and the United States (one of the most traditional Western countries regarding surnames) will also be examined.\n\nWhy\n\nFamily forms and structures, including gender norms, have undergone a massive transformation in Denmark within the past few decades, and so have the ways in which we use surnames. Name choices in families today depend to a large extent on individual preferences and less on tradition as used to be the case. Therefore, it is likely that the choices and narratives of surnames in families contain important information about and reflect family identity formation and family practices. Surname use is an underemphasized topic in Danish research, and combined with the fact that Denmark is a leading country in surname diversity, this project is very timely. My research will provide new insights into linguistic choices, family practices, identity formation, and gender roles.\n\nHow\n\nTo gain knowledge about attitudes, experiences, and opinions, I will take a qualitative approach and do semi-structured in-depth interviews with Danish couples/individuals and a smaller number of American couples/individuals. Additionally, I will make use of various historical data sources of surnames and the use thereof. The project will use sociological and sociolinguistic concepts and theories, such as doing family, doing gender, and social positioning. Employing names as a tool for studying family dynamics and identity is an innovative approach, which will allow me to draw new conclusions about today's family life and perceptions and functions of names.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project will uncover knowledge about important parts of Danish culture, namely family life and linguistic choices and attitudes. Thereby, my research will contribute to understandings of Danish culture, society, intercultural differences, and gender roles. A possible connection between surname choices and family life will constitute a very tangible relationship between language and social and cultural factors, and the interdisciplinary nature of the project means that the conclusions of the project will be useful for various scientific fields, such as onomastics, linguistics, sociology, and gender studies. Additionally, my research will be relevant to policy makers and organizations focusing on gender equality and family matters, as well as national name registers and statistics.",

The aim of the project is to gain new fundamental insights into how behaviour on the level of the individual affects social network structure and dynamical processes in the networks, by developing and using a novel modelling framework based on generative network modelling.\n\nWhy\n\nSocial networks across species show diverse structural patterns. The network structures play an important role for both proximate processes (such as flows of information and disease), and evolutionary processes. This makes them relevant scientific study objects in relation to a range of questions about social evolution, ecology, and complex systems. We now have extensive knowledge about how social networks in different species are structured, and we also have an in-depth understanding of networks as theoretical objects. But to comprehensively understand social systems, we need better insights into the link between individual behaviour and social network structures. An important step towards this is the development of realistic models for the emergence of social network structures.\n\nHow\n\nThis project takes an interdisciplinary approach and combines knowledge about social systems across species with theoretical and methodological approaches from the scientific field of networks and complex systems. A key approach in network science is a class of models called generative network models, which are computer algorithms that can generate artificial network structures from defined linking rules. This makes them excellent tools for investigating the link between individual behaviour and social structure. Taking departure in empirical knowledge about social systems across species, I will develop a model based on realistic linking rules and use this to investigate - by computer simulation - how the rules affect network structure and flows in the networks.\n\nSSR\n\nFundamental scientific knowledge about social systems and social structures is important for understanding the world around us - both nature and human society - and can also be of use both in the conservation of species and for improving human welfare.",

    "title": "Using music to model the brain's realisation of time",
    "summary": "What\n\nTime is a central constituent of the physical world and thus characterises and regulates human life. Indeed, to pursue a successful existence and achieve a flourishing state, humans are required to find ways to come to terms with the concept of time. Even though many great contributions have been produced, much is left to learn about how the brain encodes the perception of time and how time interacts with the brain to make the world meaningful to humans. Thus, in my project I wish to understand and mathematically model how the brain successfully processes temporal sequences and information evolving over time.\n\nWhy\n\n\"Throughout history, the interaction between humans and time has received a wide attention from several fields, spanning from mathematics, physics and natural sciences to the arts and humanities. \r\nMoreover, the last decades of neuroscience showed that the brain is a dynamic system characterized by (de)synchronization of neuronal populations and transitions between different functional states. Yet, what are the specific brain mechanisms that allow a sequence of information extended over time (such as music) to become meaningful for people? Indeed, what are the brain mechanisms required to remember and attribute meaning to the past, process the present and predict the future?\r\nAnswering such questions may lead us to the very core of the flourishing human brain.\r\n\"\n\nHow\n\nIn this project, I propose to expand the field by developing and using advanced analysis methods for brain data recorded with state-of-the-art machines such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Indeed, I wish to combine clustering algorithms with mathematical models to describe and simulate the brain understanding of temporal sequences. Moreover, since music is the human art that mainly acquires meaning through the logical combination of sounds extended over time, I wish to use mathematically controlled musical patterns as ideal and unique proxies to investigate the dynamical brain mechanisms responsible to build the meaning of past and present events and information and make predictions about future ones.\n\nSSR\n\nTo pursue a successful existence, humans are required to come to terms with the concept of time. Thus, understanding how the brain processes time may help us to comprehend how individuals achieve wellbeing and a flourishing state.",

    "title": "Digital Confinement. The reconfigurations of Borders and Detention Through New Technologies",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe use of new technologies for immigration control is expanding rapidly, as tech giants are investing in immigration enforcement, a market that was, until recently, dominated by technologies developed by government agencies themselves or by contractors from the prison or military industrial complex. The US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is currently installing facial recognition software on the cell-phones of asylum seekers as an alternative to immigration detention and has started collaborations with tech companies for the extractions of larger, complex datasets involving migrants and citizens who assist them within US borders.\n\nWhy\n\nThe project conceptualizes 'Digital Confinement' and the ways in which detention and internal border control are reconfigured through new technologies. While drawing on and developing existing theories on the spatial and temporal dimensions of confinement, it works with the hypothesis that the deployment of tech, such as facial recognition as an alternative to detention implies a transformation of detainability and deportability, that is, the experienced risk of being detained and deported. Beyond its theoretical significance for confinement and migration research, the project will contribute to the wider scholarly debates on public/private partnerships, on surveillance capitalism and the protection of personal data, also within the context of scientific research itself.\n\nHow\n\nIn order to understand and convey the spatial and temporal experiences of migrants submitted to 'Digital Confinement', I will carry out ethnographic fieldwork and visual research, including documentary filmmaking. In parallel, through interviews with stakeholders and documentary research, I will map the larger complex network of private and public actors who advocate for or against the use of tech for internal border control, with a focus on the political and economic logics at play. Finally, I will foster research collaborations with civil society stakeholders and Danish and international colleagues on the urgent questions of methods and ethics in research that involves tech and vulnerable populations.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project aims to contribute to the debates on policy-making, public expenditure, and the extractive practices of tech companies, while taking into account the consequences of the economy and business of migration control for targeted individuals, as well as the wider implications for all citizens concerned by tech that identify and monitor individuals.\nUnderstanding the lived, embodied experiences of surveillance and confinement, when border control is ensured through facial recognition software or other tech, is of relevance to citizens at large. Indeed, confinement and migration control are often laboratories for what is to come for the general population. While most identification technologies were developed and managed by civil servants until recently, tech companies today compile unprecedented amounts of data and develop increasingly sophisticated software to process it, with little or no consent or oversight. \nThe development of online research and data collection in 2020 has raised pressing questions around digital methods and ethics, and the project aims to foster research collaborations with civil society stakeholders and researchers in order to generate urgent sets of ethical guidelines and appropriate research methods for scholars working specifically on issues of surveillance and control of vulnerable populations.",

    "title": "Investigating Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targets in patient enteric neurons",
    "summary": "What\n\nRecent research has raised the question whether Parkinson's disease can arise in the nerve cells of the gut and spread from there to the brain. We propose a novel approach for addressing this by growing nerve stem cells isolated from standard gut biopsies from Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. This will enable us to determine whether the disease affects gut nerve cells from PD patients. By growing these nerve cells in the laboratory, we will be able to closely study the disease mechanisms and to test potential therapeutic strategies, which could prevent the disease from spreading to the brain.\n\nWhy\n\nParkinson's disease is a neurological disorder, which despite decades of research, we do not fully understand the disease mechanisms behind. We therefore only have treatments, which can temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but none that can slow down or prevent the disease from developing.\nParkinson's disease affects not only areas of our brain essential for movement, but also many other parts of our nervous system. This includes the so called enteric nervous system, which surrounds and controls our gut. Recent research indicates that the disease can arise in the enteric nervous system and spread from there to the brain. This idea is mainly based on research studies on deceased patients and animal models and has not yet been verified in living patients.\n\nHow\n\nIn this project, we will obtain nerve stem cells from the enteric nervous system using standard gut biopsies taken from Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. This technique has been established for other diseases related to the enteric nervous system, but never applied to Parkinson's disease. From these nerve stem cells, we will grow live human enteric nerves in the laboratory and study their disease-related characteristics. This will provide a unique chance to explore how the disease develops over time and allow us to therapeutically target promising pathways to potentially hinder the spread of the disease to the brain.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project will allow us to generate human Parkinson's patient specific nerve cells, which can be grown in the laboratory and applied in a variety of functional assays. These nerve cells can help address the role of the enteric nervous system in the development of Parkinson's disease and can potentially in the future enable direct studies of how environmental factors might influence the disease. Addressing the role of the ENS in PD pathogenesis could vastly improve our understanding of the disease mechanisms and potentially pave the way for new therapeutic solutions, which can prevent the disease from developing.",

    "title": "Postdoc project on Tax Law and Human Rights - The economic and legal need to safeguard legal certainty in international tax law",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project is about the protection of taxpayers' rights in international tax law. One of the greatest paradoxes of modern international tax law is the ambivalence of the EU and the OECD towards establishing a minimum protection of taxpayers' rights. In recent years, there has been an unprecedented internationalization of tax law, flanked by a high level of uncertainty about the interpretation of the rules. This tendency has been driven by the legitimate interest of States in the fight against tax abuse in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. This project analyzes the principle of legal certainty as a principle of economic efficiency in order to ascertain whether such a principle, as it is safeguarded at an EU-level, could work in international tax law to ensure taxpayers' rights.\n\nWhy\n\nTaxpayers are not merely objects, they are holders of rights. This project builds on the hypothesis that international coordination to fight tax abuse must be accompanied by effective protection of the taxpayers' rights through a global minimum standard. The financial crisis in 2008 pushed the issue of international taxation up the agenda and propelled an international coordination for strengthening the rules guarding corporate income tax. The next challenge to make this new system sustainable is to strike a balance between new, enforced rules and legal certainty to avoid adverse legal and economic consequences from too much uncertainty. This project provides a much needed analysis on how to strike this balance in practice, and the potential economic and legal upsides of doing so.\n\nHow\n\nThe research is carried out at the International Bureau for Fiscal Documentation (IBFD) in Amsterdam, which is an independent research foundation dealing exclusively with international tax law. The IBFD contains the world's most extensive collection of tax literature and data about the rules and rates of taxation globally. This institution and its experts will provide the required materials and sounding boards for the research. The outcome will be a series of articles and ultimately at least one larger conference and a textbook to finalize the project. In the long term, it is expected that this research will provide an important foundation for the continued research on taxpayer's rights at a Danish level as well.\n\nSSR\n\nTaxation is a means for states to finance their society and, fundamentally, this is achieved by influencing taxpayer behavior. In order for a tax system to be efficient, it needs to be sufficiently clear and concise, and with the ongoing major overhauls of the international system, it is pivotal to ensure that these new foundations are constructed optimally. This does not just mean enforcing the rules for the states; it also requires a level of protection for the target groups.",

We shall review changes, risks and opportunities inherent in this situation. Focusing on the intersections of multifunctional spaces, digital practices, family relations and existential beliefs, the inter-disciplinary STAY HOME research-team will develop research methods fit to gather, analyse and convey domestic experiences during the crisis.\n\nSTAY HOME examines the home as a site where social structures and autonomous existence collide and are negotiated within architectural and digital spaces. We aim to identify risks and opportunities uncovered and created by the corona crisis, asking: What counts as a good home, when and for whom?\n\nWhy\n\nSTAY HOME identifies, gathers and organizes insights and experiences related to the home which are important to preserve beyond the crisis – either because they are problematic or even risky or because they have an unforeseen potential for long-term advantages.\n\nThe project has a here-and-now dimension in that we will preserve experience while it is close at hand. But the importance rests above all with the long-range perspective. In STAY HOME we shall harvest insights that can contribute to a human-centred organization of \"home\" in all its material, technical, social and existential facets.\n\nHow\n\nWhat counts as a good home, when and for whom? are questions that demand a concerted, interdisciplinary effort. STAY HOME unites scholars from architecture, family studies, technology studies and theology for collaborative research into ethnographic archives catalogued during the first months of the crisis, including material gathered in Deltagelsens grammatik (VELUX Foundation / Winthereik & Munk), in the diary project of the National Museum (VELUX Foundation) and by crisis centres.\n\nIn our analysis of this material we shall identify a cluster of common themes suited to an integrated interdisciplinary inquiry that will be conducted in exchange with ongoing research into the histories of the early modern home at the Danish National Research Foundation Centre for Privacy Studies.\n\nSSR\n\nSTAY HOME has a documentation component. We are going to gather and analyse domestic experience during the corona crisis. Some of these experiences are novel (home schooling, professional meetings from bedrooms and kitchens), others excalate exisiting patterns (domestic violence, working from home). The project will be an archive for experiences of \"home\" in its different facets.\n\nIt is our ultimate goal to identify the opportunities and risks that the corona crisis has disclosed or created. STAY HOME will glean insights to benefit our homes as architectural, social, digital and existential spaces. It is our aim, for example, to leave material traces not only in future forms of domestic archtecture, but also in the informed handling of domestic crises.",

Consequently, these unique stem cells can be transplanted from one person to another, where they can repopulate the blood system with new cells for the entire life of the recipient. Many features of blood stem cells are still not understood, including the genetic mechanisms that control their enormous stem cell potential, which will be investigated in this project.\n\nWhy\n\nWith the numerous diseases that affect the blood system, including genetic diseases and cancer, blood stem cells have major implications in medicine. A greater understanding of the genetic programs that regulate blood stem cells could unravel novel mechanisms for stem cell maintenance and reveal new druggable targets for therapeutic intervention in multiple blood disorders.\n\nHow\n\nCRISPR/Cas is a relatively new tool to make precise changes to the human genome, and its range of applications is continually increasing. In this research project, we will employ advanced CRISPR/Cas technologies for complex genetic engineering to extend the knowledge on blood stem cell potential.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project will develop new opportunities for CRISPR/Cas in blood stem cells.

    "summary": "What\n\nOperator algebras are abstract objects introduced by Murray and von Neumann a century ago with the intention of providing a rigorous mathematical framework for the theory of quantum mechanics. Since then operator algebras has become an important independent research field which connects to many different aspects of pure mathematics.\n\nTopological dynamical systems coming, e.g., from oriented graphs generate a rich class of examples of operator algebras whose structure is reflected in the underlying dynamical system. Using a newly developed reconstruction theory, the aim of this project is to understand and answer long-standing and fundamental questions about such dynamical systems using operator algebraic tools.\n\nWhy\n\nSymbolic dynamics originated at the beginning of the 20th century as a way of modeling a broad class of physical systems with a specified discretized time evolution. However, some of the most fundamental questions, such as the existence of a deciding algorithm for when two symbolic dynamical systems are the same, remain unresolved.\n\nOperator algebras provides a new framework from which we can attack these resilient problems. This approach of bridging the two fields is promising as we have already seen a fruitful transportation of ideas over recent years.\n\nHow\n\nAs a young researcher it is tremendously beneficial to be around experienced experts engaging in discussion and collaboration. I have spent a year at the University of Wollongong in Australia working with some of the best researchers in the field, and I will spend the next year at the University of Glasgow in Scotland working with a different group of world experts. This provides an excellent environment for me to conduct my research and achieve the goals of the project.\n\nSSR\n\nThis is a project in pure mathematics, it is not motivated by social impact, but aims at nurturing the general knowledge and methods of mathematics itself. Specifically, the project links the fields of topological dynamics and operator algebras.",

Human activity, through eutrophication of lakes and rivers, has altered GHG dynamics causing a shift to greater release methane. Temperature increase is predicted to elevate methane emissions and climate change driven heat waves will lead to more frequent short-term stratification events in shallow lakes. How this will affect methane dynamics is not well understood.\n\nThis project will measure methane and stratification patterns in a shallow lake at high-frequency providing high-resolution data on GHG dynamics in lakes vulnerable to climate change impacts.

    "summary": "What\n\nThe Arctic is experiencing dramatic changes as a result of anthropogenic climate change: warming more than twice the global average. The overarching aim is to improve our understanding of fundamental aerosol-cloud processes that govern the Arctic climate and its accelerated warming.\n\nThe goal of this project is to understand what Arctic clouds are made of. To form clouds, water vapour requires a surface to make the transition to liquid droplets or ice crystals. This surface is provided by aerosols; tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere. This project will characterize the chemical and physical properties of both Arctic aerosols and also cloud residuals. Cloud residuals is what remains from cloud particles (droplets and ice crystals) when dried.\n\nWhy\n\nThe underlying processes of the observed accelerated changes in the Arctic are not well understood. However, these processes cause changes to the entire global climate system with impacts on weather, ocean circulation, ecosystems and geopolitics. Clouds play a major role in the Arctic system and are one of the main contributors to the overall uncertainties. With the continuing retreat of sea ice and new sea routes/industrial activities, new sources of particles will become more important for the formation of clouds in the Arctic. This work can contribute to improve the predictive capability of climate models by providing much needed observations and improved system/process knowledge for the Arctic, one of the most vulnerable parts of our planet, where climate change manifests most.\n\nHow\n\nUsing tools and methodologies from the fields of physics, chemistry and meteorology, I will together with researchers at Stockholm University determine experimentally and in high detail the microphysical and chemical properties of particles that act as nuclei for low-level Arctic clouds. In all most previous work in the Arctic, cloud properties were probed artificially by activating aerosol particles. However, it is possible to study cloud forming properties directly inside clouds, by measuring upon what remains from cloud particles (droplets and ice crystals) when dried. We will group and investigate various aerosol particle types and appoint their likely sources using back-trajectories.\n\nSSR\n\nThe Arctic region is particularly vulnerable to climate change. This fellowship will contribute to improve the predictive capability of climate models. We will produce knowledge, which can inform decision-making in relation to various aspects of climate change and social development in the Arctic.

This book will trace the histories of two ideas for poverty reduction: social and economic human rights (such as the right to an adequate standard of living), and the idea that poverty reduction is best accomplished through the spread of private business enterprises. It will mainly focus on the history of these two ideas from within the international organization most devoted to the cause of fighting global poverty: the United Nations. My thesis is that the ambition of securing material well-being for many people has failed partly because international development organizations made a miscalculated bet on business.\n\nWhy\n\nThe history of social and economic human rights is not well developed. Of the intellectual history of the United Nations that does exist, none focuses explicitly on the problematic of this book. By focusing on thinkers such as management theorists, this book also contributes to broadening the source base of intellectual history. Similarly, while there is a rich scholarship on the role of business in society, much less has been written on the subject from an intellectual historical perspective, especially in a non-US perspective. The book will combine a scholarly account of the intellectual history of anti-poverty policies with a timely intervention into current debates on poverty. It will be a contribution across the fields of neoliberalism, business, global inequality and human rights.\n\nHow\n\nThe book will build upon a broad variety of written sources examined from an intellectual history perspective, such as works by key development economists within the UN. It will also draw upon interviews with various UN experts, including Under-Secretary Generals. The book will be chronologically and thematically ordered, starting out with a long historical view, then investigating its key problematic from 1948 until today, mapping out the intellectual history of two ideas - business and human rights - that have been called upon to reduce global poverty.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project contributes with an intellectual historical understanding of how the UN has tried to tackle challenges of global poverty and inequality - parts of international society's grand challenges. It historicizes the idea of corporate social responsibility and how it became part of international development discourse. It thereby provides critical and historical perspective on some of contemporary society's major challenges.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThis project concerns the study of so-called topological states in the iron-based superconductors. In contrast to their non-topological counterparts, topological states are unaffected by imperfections in the host material. This robustness makes them useful as fundamental constituents of electronic devices. However, topological states are elusive and suitable host materials are rare. Recent experiments have suggested that iron-based superconductors may display such topological states, which would offer a high-quality platform for their manipulation. In this project, I will investigate the mechanisms underlying the appearance of topological states in the iron-based superconductors, and how the strong electronic interactions present in these materials affect the emergence of these states.\n\nWhy\n\nThe scientific importance of this project is two-fold. On the one hand, putting the experimental observations on firm theoretical footing is important for efficiently implementing the materials into working devices. The theoretical foundations developed in this project will therefore have implications for the design of future devices. On the other hand, there is the more fundamental question of how the strength of the electronic interactions affect the emergence of topological states in the first place. Addressing this question will teach us whether electronic interactions help or hinder the appearance of topological states and may lead to the design of new materials.\n\nHow\n\nThe work will be carried out at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. The project will employ a variety of complementary theoretical approaches to address the questions posed, and will take advantage of both analytical and numerical methods.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project is a piece of a much larger puzzle which concerns the understanding and design of quantum materials. Quantum materials typically refer to materials which, through quantum mechanical effects, exhibit extraordinary properties. These properties can for instance be the aforementioned topological states or the ability to conduct electricity without resistance. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is the ability to tailor materials for specific applications. On a shorter time-scale, this project will aid in the design of materials for storing and manipulating quantum information.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThis project will determine the role of the military in the spread of Greco-Roman culture across the Roman Empire. The Roman state ruled a vast territory containing numerous languages and cultures. Many of these cultural differences persisted throughout the history of the empire. Yet the culture of Rome still penetrated the conquered territories. The Latin language became the language of elites, and Greco-Roman customs were entrenched from Syria to the Britain. How did this cultural dissemination happen? This question will be answered by investigating the institution that interacted most directly with the broader population: the military. It will investigate how recruits were exposed to Greco-Roman culture, and how they in turn brought this culture back to their local environments.\n\nWhy\n\nThe study of the military has been a holdout for 'Romanization'. In the wider discipline of Roman studies, however, this paradigm has come under criticism in recent decades. This project will instead employ the anthropological model of the great and little tradition. The advantage of this model is that it does not reduce cultural interaction to a binary opposition of the cosmopolitan and the provincial. It can be used to show that agrarian societies remained culturally stratified while a cultural dialogue was nonetheless maintained between the strata. Applying this model to our data on the Roman army, the project will demonstrate that it is a more appropriate framework for understanding the cultural history of the Roman provinces than previous theoretical approaches.\n\nHow\n\nThe project will integrate both primary sources and existing research into its holistic view of the workings of the premodern imperial structure. As this is the first instance of the model of the great and little tradition being applied to this research field, this particular strategy for synthesizing individual studies into a broader understanding of the imperial Roman world as a whole has not been done before. The primary sources for the project include the Bu Njem ostraca from North Africa and the Vindolanda tablets from Britain, source corpora which grant unique vistas into the everyday lives of Roman garrisons. The project will be carried out at the School of Classics at the University of St. Andrews in the UK, which has a strong community of Roman scholars.\n\nSSR\n\nBy investigating elite and popular interaction in the Roman Empire, the project will demonstrate that the ancient Greco-Roman civilization upon which modern Europe is founded was not the top-down elite constructions it is often thought to be. It was instead a complex culture, shaped and re-shaped by long-running processes of low intensity cultural interaction between different social classes and geographical regions. The project will show how the agency of the broader population helped to forge this culture, but also demonstrate how this agency was always constrained by the stratified nature of ancient society.",

    "title": "DECODENSE: Mean-Field Density Matrix Decompositions",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe main objective of the DECODENSE project is the development of new, rapid simulation tools in the field of quantum chemistry. In particular, I will be concerned with the acceleration of contemporary, state-of-the-art electronic structure methods by means of modern machine learning. Through the formulation of novel theory and its efficient implementation within optimized computational workflows, I am proposing new manners by which to decompose quantum-chemical simulations. In turn, these decompositions will make the underlying theory increasingly befitting to the deployment of machine learning in inferring physical properties from chemical structures alone. Importantly, these mappings will be made without recourse to explicit and exceedingly expensive electronic structure treatments.\n\nWhy\n\nThe inner workings of molecules and materials may these days be probed and modelled by advanced simulation tools on modern computer architectures. These simulations not only serve as a complement to traditional empirical explorations, but also as practical extensions in cases where these prove infeasible, hazardous, or exceedingly expensive. The crux of the matter, however, is the fact that today's primary computational workhorse - known as Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) - is inherently too computationally costly to warrant large-scale simulations of, e.g., potential drug prospects or emerging solid-state batteries. To that end, my project will ultimately be concerned with circumventing the prohibitive scaling wall of KS-DFT by deploying machine learning to the problem.\n\nHow\n\nA Carlsberg Foundation Reintegration Fellowship will enable me to return home to Denmark after two successful postdoctoral stays abroad. The fellowship will see me integrate into one of our country's most vibrant and interdisciplinary academic environments at DTU Chemistry, which is certain to offer me both the necessary support and the scientific independence to drive my ongoing endeavours towards the development of more accurate takes on machine-learned quantum chemistry to new levels. With a sound core of theory development and high-performance computing in roughly equal parts, my project is bound to offer a manifold of physical and chemical insight as well as a firm basis for forming my own research lab at DTU in the years to come.\n\nSSR\n\nThe DECODENSE project has as its primary ambition to provide clues and answers to some of today's most pressing grand challenges in the domain of physical chemistry, such as, which compounds in chemical space exhibit a particular key property? Or how is chemical energy converted to electrical energy at a detailed atomistic level in next-generation battery candidates? These complex, yet stimulating societal problems will all benefit from the availability of accelerated, machine-learned simulation tools, which can enter into high-throughput screening and inverse design protocols aimed at exploring the functional materials of tomorrow. Due to its versatility, the outcomes of my project are fully intended to add utility value beyond the niche of fundamental basic science.",

    "title": "Decolonizing Political Action",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project explores the nature of postcolonial agency through a comparative analysis of the modes of doing political action of four exemplary figures who are positioned very differently within the space of postcoloniality: Ho Chi Minh, the anti-colonial revolutionary communist fighter turned statesman who founded modern Vietnam; Frantz Fanon, the French résistant who diagnosed the pathologies of colonialism and joined the Algerian war of independence against France; Dr Wangarī Maathai, the Kenyan women's rights and environmental activist and Nobel peace prize recipient who stood up against the predatory practices of an authoritarian postcolonial state; and Tsvetan Todorov, the Bulgarian-French anthropologist and critic of both colonialism and totalitarianism.\n\nWhy\n\nIn advancing the understanding of what constitutes the nature of political action, the project contributes to a central research question of both political science and of international relations. It also contributes centrally to postcolonial studies by, firstly, ushering in a much-needed attention to political agency that helps move it beyond its original focus on the oppressive structures and enduring effects of colonial rule into the present. Secondly, it helps further its central epistemological commitment to decolonise or 'de-Westernise' the tools of analysis. Lastly, it helps develop the fast-growing subfield of postcolonial international relations. In this way, the project helps build bridges between several disciplines by advancing some of their foundational questions.\n\nHow\n\nThe research for the project will be conducted, first, through a careful reading of the writings of the four postcolonial figures to understand how they themselves conceived their political actions. This will be complemented, second, with fieldwork visits and interviews in Kenya, Algeria, Martinique and Vietnam to appraise their historical impacts and the contemporary reception of their work in the contexts where they made a difference. Histories of French and British colonisation and the colonial archives in Aix-en-Provence and Kew will constitute the third research sites. Together these three research strands will yield the materials required to complete the research monograph, Decolonizing Political Action.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project directly addresses one of the pressing global societal concerns of our age, how to grapple with the legacies of a colonialism that has fundamentally shaped our worlds in ways that we have only begun to take the measure of, and not only in the former colonies, as expressed recently by the Black Lives Matter movement and its numerous manifestations around the globe. Specifically, at a time when many are trying to come to terms with what it means to act politically within spaces and institutions that are deeply imprinted with unequal, racialized and gendered relations, it has become essential to learn from the ingenuity, creativity and trajectories of early postcolonial actors, in order to understand how, against all odds, they were able to effect real changes in their local contexts.",

    "summary": "What\n\nNature has since ever used complex biological nanostructures to harvest sunlight and convert it to chemical energy, fueling the growth of plants worldwide. My ArtPlast concept is based on replicating the successful processes in plants and developing a platform technology, where more and more bio-inspired features can be added, opening for a wealth of new application areas. More specifically, I will synthesize an artificial chloroplast using conjugated donor:non-fullerene acceptor:antioxidant nanoparticles that facilitates photosynthetic processes in the same way that nature has so delicately perfected, thus providing an efficient and stable material system for green energy technologies - H2 evolution and solar electricity generation.\n\nWhy\n\nOrganic semiconductors are promising materials for photocatalytic water splitting - in which solar energy is used to produce hydrogen, and for photovoltaic cells - where solar energy is used to directly produce electricity, as they enable truly green and sustainable energy solutions. Very recent development of non-fullerene acceptor molecules has disrupted these technologies, drastically boosting their conversion efficiencies. However, key disadvantages with current available solutions make them unstable over time. The Artplast platform will exploit nature's solutions of overcoming these issues in plants, thus advancing future solar energy generation and storage, in the same way as nature- without degrading its organic constituents.\n\nHow\n\nI will mimic the energy-converting and self-healing mechanism of a leaf, in which photooxidatively protecting carotenoids are confined near the chlorophylls which oversee light absorption, energy transfer and electric charge separation. In the heart of the platform are the new non-fullerene organic semiconductors with naturally occurring stabilizers within size- and morphology-controlled nanoparticles. Using in-depth advanced spectroscopic and high-resolution synchrotron-powered imaging techniques, and aided by machine learning techniques, I will reveal the delicate morphology-photophysics-photochemistry relationships in these materials, which will enable me to develop the design guidelines for efficient and reliable energy material systems.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project will push forward the fields of organic photovoltaics and photocatalysis, and also open up for applications in related renewable technologies, such as CO2 reduction catalysts, as well as the field of organic semiconductor-based printed electronics, which is expected to provide energy efficient components of the future. This project thus contributes to a truly zero-emission society, using solely low environmental impact approaches, which is recognized as the grand societal challenge of our times.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe relationship between religion and politics has for decades been an important field of study and a topic for public debates, but lately interest has been raised towards the relationship between religion and economy. This project seeks to provide an intellectual history of the present by investigating the role of religion in contemporary debates on financial policy in the European Union within an overall context of crisis-policies from 2008 to 2020. Focusing on Italy and Denmark the project seeks to examine the faultline between the frugal EU-member countries promoting austerity measures and those subjected to these measures, from an assumption that economy is also a cultural and social phenomenon affected by religious heritage, national narratives and cultural history.\n\nWhy\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the subsequent debt-crisis of Southern Europe in 2012- 2013 stirred scholarly interest in the connection between economy and religion. Since then, attention has only increased. Much of the research has been focusing on the intellectual historical developments of a religio-economical complex and less on the contemporary consequences for policy-making and transnational collaboration. \nThis project augments the historical perspective with a contemporary focus and attempt to develop a theoretical toolbox capable of investigating the intertwinement of religion and economy in the present. In doing so the project expects to shed light on disagreements on financial policy as a continuous point of contention within the EU from a novel perspective.\n\nHow\n\nThe theoretical framework of the project will be developed under the moniker economic religion in dialogue with Gentile's theory on political religion, the emerging research field of economic theology and recent research on debt and guilt as e.g. Stimilli and Lazzarato.\nThe project is centred around two case-studies, namely Italy and Denmark. The empirical data will comprise of three types of documents: Constitutional and legal documents; selected debates and opinion-pieces in the media by politicians and public intellectuals; selected debates around financial policies and public statements within the European Union from 2008-2020.\n\nSSR\n\nThrough the examination of the way religion influences various conceptions of the economy and effects different shapings of financial policy in Italy and Denmark, the project attempt to generate knowledge that could contribute to a raised cultural awareness and competency in transnational policy-making and public debate. Thus, the project seeks to qualify discussions about European integration and collaboration within the framework of the European Union.\r\nFurther, the project seeks to provide theoretically and empirically grounded arguments about the impact of religion on economic assumptions thus enhancing the understanding of the interplay between religion and society, both historical and contemporary.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThis project introduces a new concept, referred to here as 'mood synchronicity'. While media\nsynchronicity focuses on how media transmit cognitive states from one individual to another, mood\nsynchronicity focuses on how media transmit affective states. \n\nBuilding on this new concept, this project aims to explore how shared mood influences different types of collaborative tasks.\n\nMore specifically, the project explores how the characteristics of different communication media moderate the relationship between shared mood and coordinated behaviors.\n\nWhy\n\n\"Online collaboration has become widespread in 2020. It is not clear how the different technologies used are contributing to emotional isolation. Understanding this may be important\r\nfor managing productivity, conflict, and collective wellbeing. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to answer three key research questions:\r\n- What are the essential components of mood synchronicity?\r\n- How do specific media characteristics impact on mood synchronicity?\r\n- How does technology-enabled mood synchronicity impact different patterns of coordinated behavior?\"\n\nHow\n\nConsistent with seminal literature of media richness and media synchronicity, the project will address the three research questions in three different contexts. \n\nFirst, we will explore contexts where teams are primarily\nco-located, meaning they can communicate using the media of their choice, e.g. local firms in Copenhagen. \n\nSecond, we will explore contexts where individuals are partly co-located, meaning some individuals can communicate using the media of their choice and others are limited to remote media,\ne.g. Copenhagen-based teams that include people from multiple countries. \n\nThird, we will explore contexts where few if any individuals are co-located, meaning they can only use remote media, e.g. open source software communities.\n\nSSR\n\nCollectively, these studies will provide the practical and theoretical basis to understand how different\ncommunication media moderate the impact of shared mood on coordinated work behaviors. This will be important as organizations adapt to new norms of work, post Covid-19. The answer may not be as straightforward as finding the media that best enable mood contagion. Indeed, extrapolating from\nfindings on media synchronicity and creative conflict in teams, it may also\nemerge that some tasks benefit from asymmetrical moods. A clearer understanding of the relationship\nbetween tasks, media, and mood will therefore add valuable insight to future management practices and system design.",

    "title": "Unheard workers: behind a foreign diplomatic architecture of the 1960s in Rome.",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project aims to study the construction of foreign diplomatic architecture in the 1960s in Rome, Italy. The main case study is Det Danske Institut i Rom (1967), but the project considers also the Japan Cultural Institute (1962) and the British Embassy (1968). Their construction had many converging aspects. They all practiced a mono-material construction, from scratch, following home architectural building traditions, though displaced on Italian ground. Similarly, their current historiography is widely forged around authorial master-dominations: where each construction was conceived only by a famous architect. However, this project aims to widen the field, through recognising its many 'blind spots', and to include all those actors not credited and recognised yet: the unheard workers.\n\nWhy\n\nThe scientific relevance is related, content-wise, to the need to investigate, historically, the contemporary export dynamics of architectural production. The project frames three buildings that embody, for their ontological function, the same cross-cultural dynamics that have allowed domestic 'islands' to be built into hosting foreign contexts since post-war. Method-wise, the project reappraises dominant architectural historiographies including diversity and social justice (i.e. labour and class disparity) as new keys of research. The research, in fact, argues that the establishment of the foreign diplomatic architecture was strongly conditioned by hosting Italian materials, people, and labour practices: though these have been, so far, neglected circumstances by historians.\n\nHow\n\nIn order to attain its goal, the project states its historical background in those cross-cultural histories of architecture that happened in the latter half of the twentieth century. The method of research proposed are 'archival review' and 'oral history'. For the first one, it will investigate archival materials that have not been explored yet but that are crucial to cast new lights on the current field (e.g. bilateral agreements, building site minutes, correspondences, fax, photos, tender contracts, et al.). For the second one, when practicable, interviews will be conducted with those people that can tell about the occupancy and construction of buildings, adding new layers of comprehension through personal anecdotes and private correspondences.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project deals with diversity and inclusivity. It includes equity and social justice into architectural historical research in both content and method. To build a diverse academia answer to a call into scientific social responsibility. Unfolding considerations of ethnicity, gender, labour, and class disparity as lens of investigation, is, in fact, an imperative need towards the decolonisation of the modes in which we approach and research architectural history in contemporary times. Moreover, the research might be beneficial also to those contemporary private architectural practices, that are rooting only in Denmark in 2019 more than half of their turnover to export in foreign countries; but, still, they need guidance on how their home practices can be adapted to foreign settings.",

Iceland is an ideal setting to investigate naturally occurring shifts in environment due to; i) its sensitive climatic location within the North Atlantic, ii) the geochronological (and correlative) potential of tephra visible in various sedimentary archives iii) the lack of human influence until the documented settlement c. 871 AD.

    "summary": "What\n\nMost of the stars we see in local galaxies were formed more than 10 billion years ago at a time when galaxies appeared radically different. How these early galaxies formed and evolved into the galaxies in the local universe is still not well understood. The key to establishing this is to understand how the building blocks of the galaxies (i.e. gas, dust and stars) interact and evolve. This project will provide insight into the evolution of galaxies by measuring some of their key physical parameters: dynamical masses, metallicities and molecular gas masses, for a sample of galaxies not subject to previous selection biases e.g. how fast stars are formed and black hole activity. These measurements will help reveal how stars are formed in both rapidly evolving and more passive environments.\n\nWhy\n\nThe rate of production of stars throughout the history of the Universe has not been constant. From the formation of the first galaxies 13 billion years ago, the rate of cosmic star-formation increased, peaking around 10 billion years ago, and has been steadily decreasing since. This evolution in the star formation history, suggest that stars in local and distant galaxies formed under different conditions. Theories and models describing star-formation processes within local galaxies, are often applied to rapidly evolving distant galaxies. It is unclear, however, if these models accurately describe the internal properties in distant galaxies. This project will provide insight into what drives star-formation in distant galaxies, and the differences between local and distant galaxies.\n\nHow\n\nI have been awarded observing time on the Very Large Telescope (at ESO) to obtain data which will allow me to measure the internal processes such as rotation and metallicity of a sample of distant galaxies. These processes are believed to be key in the formation of stars in distant galaxies. The molecular gas phase is the birthplace of stars and measurements of the molecular gas masses are therefore crucial in order to establish the amount of cold gas available for star-formation. However, such measurements are highly uncertain for distant galaxies. These observations will help improve how we determine the molecular gas mass and how this is dependent on for example the metallicity. This project will shed new light on the conditions stars are formed under in distant galaxies.\n\nSSR\n\nAstronomy is a popular subject with the public, due to the detailed and colourful images of, for example, planets, local star-forming nebulae and galaxies, and the fascination of understanding the origin of 'us' and our world. However, popular interest in distant galaxies has been limited due to low-resolution images, in which they appear as \"fuzzy blobs\". With this project we are moving towards seeing distant galaxies with detail on scales comparable to that of local galaxies, and will show the importance of Denmark's engagement in scientific flagships such as the European Southern Observatory. This project will cement Danish leadership of an international team using world class observatories to understand how galaxies evolve. This project will offer a unique opportunity to increase the curiosity and knowledge of distant galaxies and help spark an enhanced interest in astronomy, as well as in STEM subjects in general.",

    "title": "Protoclusters and Supermassive Black Holes",
    "summary": "What\n\nGalaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally-bound objects in the Universe.  Millions of light-years in size and containing up to thousands of galaxies residing in massive dark matter halos, they are truly amongst the most awe-inspiring  objects in the Universe. However, their alluring beauty so prominently on display in the present-day Universe belies what is likely a complex and prolonged formation history. The project aims to shed new light on how galaxy clusters formed and evolved with cosmic time and how powerfully accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of the clusters  affected the cluster evolution. It will do so by making use of new comprehensive surveys of distant galaxy clusters conducted at multiple wavelengths and state-of-the-art numerical simulations.\n\nWhy\n\nGalaxy clusters are the building blocks of the large scale structure of the Universe. Understanding how they formed and evolved is an important part of our endeavour to know our cosmic origins. Galaxies in clusters frequently and strongly interact compared to galaxies in the field. Galaxy clusters are, therefore, our best laboratories for studying up close the full spectrum of physical mechanisms governing galaxy evolution. We know hardly anything about the nature of supermassive black holes and how they affect and are themselves affected by the build-up of the massive galaxies and the clusters in which they reside. That there is a physical link is strongly suggested by the fact that accreting supermassive black holes are exclusively found in overdense protocluster regions of the Universe.\n\nHow\n\nThe project builds on new wide and deep surveys that trace the evolution of galaxy protoclusters across cosmic time. It targets galaxy-overdensities in protoclusters during the Cosmic Dawn era, when the Universe was about one billion years old, and protoclusters first emerged, and the subsequent Cosmic Noon era when clusters rapidly assembled. The effects of supermassive black holes on cluster growth are examined by targeting protoclusters containing an accreting supermassive black hole in their central massive galaxy and protoclusters that do not. The project's full potential is realised in symbiosis with computer simulations of the transformation of protoclusters, containing supermassive black holes and numerous young galaxies, to today's massive clusters of mostly dormant galaxies.\n\nSSR\n\nIt is a priority of the project to engage in public outreach. The scientific questions and results of the project will be announced and disseminated on social media and news outlets. We aim to pique the curiosity and install a sense of wonder towards astronomy and science in the general public, and especially in young people. The technological discoveries of tomorrow that will help us overcome the many challenges the world is facing will come from the young and children of today who will go on and study science and engineering at university.",

    "title": "Future Desert: Wastelands Imaginaries of the Anthropocene",
    "summary": "What\n\nIn a world governed by rising temperatures, uncontrollable wildfires, decade long droughts and extreme weather, the image of a future desert planet is evoked on a routine basis. Hypothesizing that the notion of 'future desert' acts as one of two master tropes of the Anthropocene (the other being the flood), the monograph Future Desert: Wasteland Imaginaries of the Anthropocene will therefore explore the cultural significance of the desert in imagined futures of catastrophic collapse caused by anthropogenic change. The central research question is thus: if 'the Anthropocene itself can usefully be understood as a science fiction trope',  how and why has the image of a 'future desert' come to stand as a trope for anthropogenic change in general and for global warming in particular?\n\nWhy\n\nThe monograph will build its methodological foundations on Elizabeth DeLoughrey's recent decolonial/ecologist work on 'allegory' as being 'the fundamental rhetorical mode for figuring the planet as well as the historical rift between part and whole that is symbolized by the Anthropocene'. In addition to this, the intersection of science fiction studies with disaster studies through imaginaries of worst case scenarios is significant, as is the manner in which 'science fiction infuses science and vice versa' through futurist projections of present and potential technologies and their latent dystopian/utopian outcomes.\n\nHow\n\nWhile literary in nature in its focus on narrative and allegory, the project is willfully eclectic in its selection of 'texts' analyzed. Including examples from literature over film, computer games, journalism, photography and fine arts that employ 'future desert' imagery in order to conceptualize forms of potential planetary catastrophic collapse, the monograph will offer a comprehensive analysis of a multi-generic corpus of material that covers a wide range of scenarios of catastrophic anthropogenic change, e.g. global warming, nuclear warfare, pollution, or deforestation.\n\nSSR\n\nThe monograph will offer a much-needed revision of the idea of the desert as more than a void space in the colonial and imperialist periphery, and rather as a central trope for future regional as well as planetary collapse. Second, the monograph will specifically enrich a growing and urgently needed Anthropocene vocabulary, as well as more generally raise awareness into the importance of narrative and allegory in environmental discourse.",

    "title": "Vanishing Points: Changing Images of Protest in Hong Kong",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe ongoing protest movement in Hong Kong was remarkably visual, with hundreds of protest wall complexes across the territory and massive amounts of visual material on digital platforms. The explicit use of the image as part of the protest movement in Hong Kong, has (once again) shown us just how central the image is to the formation of political imaginaries- thus making it all the more important to analyse these images along with what happens when the conditions to produce these images are severely constrained. Thus, this project enquires into the shifting visual politics of the Hong Kong protests by analysing the changing images of the protest movement along with the shift in political space for protest with the introduction of the new national security legislation (NSL) June 30th 2020.\n\nWhy\n\nThe NSL effectively criminalised the movement and its images. As a consequence, the visual presence of the movement in the territory was made to vanish by movement participants. While political analysts struggled to understand the consequences of this legislation, the disappearance of protest images gave the answer up-front: the Hong Kong that was, had disappeared in a flash. Or at least, that was what the protesters would like for us to see. The circumstances inflicted by the NSL for a moment crystalized how censorship and self-censorship unfold in tandem and thus provide a unique opportunity to study a region in transition. Because what is actually going on? Is Hong Kong disappearing? What are the consequences - for the movement and its images - of this new legislation?\n\nHow\n\nI propose a longitudinal study for the analysis of the images of the protest movement from it began in May 2019 and until June 2021, a year after the introduction of the NSL. In the analysis of the images of the protest movement, I include physical images and visual material hung on protest walls and I include digital images that are shared, reshared and deleted on SoME platforms and messaging services. I approach the \"image\" in its broadest sense, that is, I research the image as \"image events.\" Image events refer to the image as a process, including the way images are made, circulated, recirculated and responding to situations taking place on the public arena. The image events thus connect the digital and physical realms into a circuit for the production of visual protest material.\n\nSSR\n\nThe political situation in Hong Kong is affecting the entire world as Hong Kong's newfound position as exponent of the authoritarianism of the Chinese state requires reaction from the international community. A study of the consequences of the NSL on the shifting visuality of the ongoing protest movement in Hong Kong is thus immensely important to our understanding of Hong Kong's changing place in the world and perhaps more importantly to our understanding of Hong Kong's position as an inescapable part of the Chinese state's territory and jurisdiction. There are still many unknowns in relations to the introduction of the NSL, thus it is important to follow and track the ongoing direct use and indirect consequences of the law in order for the international community to gain a proper understanding of the actual situation in Hong Kong.",

    "summary": "What\n\nAnimals and insects have an in-built GPS (spatial navigation) system housed in the entorhinal cortex of the brain, which is only partially understood in mammals. A number of navigation-related functions have been discovered to lie in this brain region, such as, object recognition, processing speed movement and processing location, however the cells underlying these functions have been identified merely from their electrical firing characteristics and their gene profiles are unknown. There is a need to understand the complexity of the entorhinal cortex and how spatial navigation works. In this project we aim to study the spatial navigation system across several species at the single cell level in an effort to acquire an understanding of its unique and common properties across animals.\n\nWhy\n\nThis research will help to improve the classification of the cell types that are both common and unique to different species in the processing of navigation. Animals navigate using very different mechanism based on varying sensory inputs (e.g. auditory mechanisms in echolocation of bats compared to the detection of the earth's magnetic field in sea turtles). This project will help provide comprehensive insight into how different sensory information is processed which is relatively unknown outside of mammals. This project will also help to provide a more complete map of the cell types that exist in the entorhinal cortex as well as identify their roles in the mammalian spatial navigation system, which in many respects, is unknown.\n\nHow\n\nWe will first map the cell types and diversity of the spatial navigation system in bats, wolves, sea turtles, homing pigeons and leaf-cutter ants by performing RNA sequencing at the single cell level using the 10x Genomics system and analyze the data using bioinformatics. We will then further characterize the individual cells within the mammalian entorhinal cortex by combining single cell RNA sequencing with electrical measurements of neurons to match the cell's gene profile with its electrical profile using a large mammalian model, the pig. This will help to coordinate our molecular knowledge of the entorhinal cortex with the region's known functions.\n\nSSR\n\nThe entorhinal cortex in humans is one of the first regions in the brain that succumbs to the detrimental effects of Alzheimer's disease. By understanding the basic makeup of the mammalian entorhinal cortex, scientists in the future will have the tools and know how to understand why the entorhinal cortex is affected first and why it is so vulnerable to this disease. One of the grand challenges for society is to find better treatments and potential cures for diseases that are prevalent in the aging population. This research project contributes to the basic biological understanding of the entorhinal cortex and may provide clues to foster future research in the Alzheimer's disease field.",

    "title": "Translating Philology: Babylonian Poetry and the Recreation of Textual Crises",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project explores the overlap between philology and translation studies: two fields that have much in common but, at present, very little interdisciplinary dialogue. I take philology to be the study of textual crises, meaning that the discipline is dedicated to undoing whatever problems prevent us from reading a given text. In the case of ancient poetry, that often means a whole range of problems, from missing sections to divergent manuscripts. In this project, I explore how the crises that define philology make their way into translation, studying the strategies that translators use to depict - or more commonly, obscure - the problems of the sources. All those strategies rest on often unstated theoretical assumptions and can have wide-ranging implications for the study of literature.\n\nWhy\n\nThe efforts of philologists and translators often goes unappreciated, partly because their work tends to make itself invisible: to casual readers, a translation often seems to be a single stable text, scrubbed clean of all traces of the processes that produced it. In this project, I will develop new strategies for giving non-specialist readers more access to the editorial choices that go on behind the scenes, so that they too can follow how ancient texts move from damaged manuscripts to readable renditions. My aim is to produce innovative, theoretical, interdisciplinary, and workable approaches to the translation of ancient literature, which does not suppress the complexity of the texts but instead uses their crises as an occasion to reflect on how literary aesthetics and meaning are made.\n\nHow\n\nThe project will consist of two parts: a theoretical study of existing approaches to the translation of ancient literature, drawing on samples from a wide variety of languages and cultures; and an experimental, research-based translation of the Babylonian epic \"Enuma Elish\", in which I will develop, test, and reflect on a range of new strategies for rendering philological issues that are commonly obscured by the process of translation. I am particularly interested in finding new ways for philology and translation to relay the multiplicity of meaning, the textual variation, and the poetic richness that is found in ancient texts, rather than reducing them to a single, seemingly fixed set of choices.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project will provide a set of practical, theoretically informed tools that translators of ancient texts can use when faced with difficult challenges in their sources, such as lacunae, cruxes, and variations between manuscripts. It is my hope that these tools can lead to more informative translations, which give non-specialist readers a better sense of ancient literature as it actually is, in all its variety and richness. The project is especially focused on ancient literature from outside the Western world, taking as its case study a major work of Babylonian poetry: it will thereby help to broaden both the popular and the academic sense of literary history, so that, instead of flowing only through ancient Greece and Rome, it can englobe a much wider group of cultures and languages.",

    "summary": "What\n\nIt is often said that the eyes are a window onto the human soul. Just as suggestive of inner states and traits as the eyes, however, is the human voice. Changes in the speaker's voice, and differences between speakers, can signal a wide range of different meanings (to do e.g. with attractiveness, honesty, warmth, etc.). In our project, we adopt a highly interdisciplinary approach to explore two broader areas of interest: 1. positive and negative trait assessment of vocal variation (vocal traits of villains and heroes; vocal elements of creepiness; vocal variation and crisis; vocal variation in relating positive and negative news); and 2. sociobiologically conditioned vocal variation (effects of alcohol and smoking on voice quality; vocal stereotypes related to alcohol and smoking).\n\nWhy\n\nThis project expands our knowledge of how the human voice can signal positive and negative characteristics in its owner. While work in sociolinguistics and social psychology has documented some such signalling potentials of vocal variation (e.g., attractiveness, honesty), the findings available within each relevant discipline do not, as a rule, look out to the methodological tools and findings on the same or similar topic in other disciplines. Our understanding of the signalling potentials of the human voice will thus always be suboptimal unless a highly interdisciplinary approach is employed. This is where this project comes in. We very much aim to bridge gaps between the different groups of experts on vocal variation. The output of the project has both theoretical and societal relevance.\n\nHow\n\nWe will target specific research questions relating to the two broader areas specified above. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches will be adopted. The data will primarily consist of four subsets: 1. existing film corpora; 2. existing political speeches; 3. newly collected articulatory and acoustic data; 4. newly collected attitudinal data.\n\nAn important part of the project is establishing an interdisciplinary lab at the Department of English, Aarhus University. We aim to establish a sustainable and permanent environment for interdisciplinary and international voice research with many applications in the long run. Apart from bringing together existing expertise within the department's different divisions, we also aim to bring a range of international experts together.\n\nSSR\n\nVoice-based communication pervades our lives. Any sector or field concerned with effective\nverbal communication should be interested in our results, and any recipient of such verbal\ncommunications should be interested in their potential impact.",

    "title": "Metropolitan Parliamentary Representation",
    "summary": "What\n\nLocated in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific primarily, periphery territories are areas that have some autonomy but are tied to a metropolitan power in such a way that they do not hold full local autonomy. In practice, their degree of autonomy varies: Some hold the integrated status of a special municipality within their metropole, while others only have a few areas - most generally foreign affairs and defense - decided within their metropole. Among other arenas, such decisions are deliberated within metropolitan parliaments. Through a comparative study of how the interests of people living in periphery territories are represented within their metropolitan parliaments, this project generates new knowledge about current periphery-metropole relations.\n\nWhy\n\nThough the way peripheries are represented within their metropolitan parliaments constitutes an important substantive and symbolic part of the metropole-periphery relation, not much is known about this. Especially, though comparative knowledge on this type of representation is highly needed to qualify scientific and political deliberation on present and future periphery-metropole relations globally there is a dearth of such knowledge. Besides overcoming this lack of knowledge, the spatial incoherence of metropolitan parliamentary representation constitutes a novel case within the literature on equal political representation. Thus, studying this \"odd case\" may further theoretic innovation within the area of representation theory.\n\nHow\n\nThe project consists of a case study of the representation of Greenland in the Danish Parliament, Aruba, and Bonaire in the Dutch parliament, and Gibraltar in the British parliament. Here, representation in its formal, descriptive, substantive, and symbolic forms will be studied (Pitkin, 1967). The cases are chosen to provide for a study with formal institutional - and national - diversity and the study focuses on the past decade, thus including important events such as Hurricane Irma (2017), and periods following recent referendums on self-determination in Greenland (in 2009), and Bonaire (2010). The project employs elite in-depth interviews, together with content analysis of representative actions, and legal analysis.\n\nSSR\n\nThe geographical location of most periphery territories makes them especially exposed to current climate changes, several of these are habited by groups of indigenous citizens among others and many are low- and middle-income areas. Additionally, most are prior colonies, and thus their situation has been on the agenda of the UN since its creation. By generating new important knowledge on the political situation of these and setting forth a set of normative ideals for good metropolitan representation, this project informs political deliberation on the political situation of the areas. To create the most value for citizens in the involved areas, the project holds several measures to ensure that its findings are dissembled to relevant actors from civil society and public institutions.",

    "title": "A New International Order in Cultural Life? An Institutional Perspective on the Music Field in Northern Europe",
    "summary": "What\n\nOver the past two decades, the internationalization of cultural life in Europe has accelerated with the sweeping growth of online services such as YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon, and of international ownership extending into live music and sports. This internationalization enables new flows and forms of connectivity, while also  challenging local traditions and forms of organizing. It also challenges conventional thinking about culture and its relationship with media. This project will develop new sociological theory and methodology to analyze the changing outlook and functions of cultural institutions in northern Europe, focusing on the music field. The wider aim is to create more informed thinking in the fields of culture and communication in the interest of the common good.\n\nWhy\n\nThe rapid internationalization of media and ownership in cultural life presents challenges to the sociology of culture and related fields such as cultural economy. This project develops institutional theory in cultural sociology from the perspective that cultural institutions are evolving in new international processes of digitalization and centralization of ownership. This perspective can help overcome methodological nationalism and atomistic platform thinking. In addition, elements of communication history and media studies are integrated, including the mediatization perspective that media now constitute new kinds of institutions and transform the conditions of cultural domain, resulting in discursive tensions between culture and media and in renewed calls for government intervention.\n\nHow\n\nThe project is based on research in the music field in northern Europe over the past decade and will expand into media organizations and media policy, involving interviews with managements and archival research into public policy and European communication history. In addition, the project will systematically map the evolution of international media and international ownership in the music field in Denmark, Germany, and Holland since the 1980s. The research is organized around case studies of institutional developments, focusing on the changes in discourse on culture and in the interactions between culture and media organizations.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project promotes scientific social responsibility (SSR) in terms of knowledge interests, relevance to societal actors, and relationship building. First, it seeks to produce foundational knowledge of important changes in cultural life to broaden and deepen contemporary conversations and stimulate reflexivity about culture and the value of cultural research with an ideal of the common good. Second, the project produces knowledge of relevance to actors in cultural and media organizations and in governments. Third, it strengthens long-term relationships between public and private actors by creating knowledge that is useful for communication between these actors and helps strengthen their legitimacy in a democratic and inclusive society. The project further aims to build trust and collaboration between academia and the cultural and media sectors through transparent and ethical representation and through the quality of research itself.",

    "summary": "What\n\nContemporary work is often described as 'feminized' - meaning that the conditions which were once primarily associated with women workers are now relevant across the work force. These conditions include temporary, informal and flexible work contracts, care work, emotional labour, and work that takes place in the home. This project will study twentieth-century literary representations of women's work in anglophone literature, arguing that the historical literary engagement with this topic can be used to develop theorisations of today's 'feminized' work world. The project will bring together literature from diverse anglophone contexts including the U.K., Nigeria and Kenya, to show how literature from the past can enrich understandings of contemporary work lives.\n\nWhy\n\nThe project will contribute to new methods of literary historiography by showing that an archive of existing literary representations of \nwomen's work from Britain, sub-Saharan Africa and other anglophone contexts can gain new relevance for analysing the the contemporary feminization of labour. In addition, it will contribute to the discussion of feminized work beyond literary studies by showing how analysis of literary \ntexts can produce new perspectives on the meanings of feminization.\n\nHow\n\nThe primary methodology is close reading: the detailed textual analysis of \nliterary works focusing on their formal and thematic qualities. The project comprises 3 sub-projects, each of which focuses on a different global anglophone context, including British realist fiction and post-colonial African novels. For each sub-project, a group of literary texts will be selected as a focus on the basis of their engagements with feminized labour. Close readings of literary texts will be placed into dialogue with theoretical accounts \nof feminization from the social sciences.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project will contribute to a fuller, more holistic understanding of contemporary work, its \nmeanings and its lived experiences.

    "title": "Protestant Aesthetics of the Nordic Welfare States",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project focuses on the impact of Protestant aesthetics on the Nordic welfare states through the study of literary works. In \"A Protestant Aesthetic?\", Daniel T. Jenkins describes how Protestant ethics has founded an aesthetic ideal that resembles \"a building site. But the eye should discern some of the ultimate glory of the building even if it is unfinished.\" The project starts at the intersection of the Modern Breakthrough ideal of debating problems and religious traditions. It relates the metaphor of perceiving Nordic societies as \"building sites\" to the welfare state paradigm of creating reformations rather than revolutions. The thesis is that since the Modern Breakthrough Nordic welfare literature has debated problems by perceiving the Nordic welfare project as a \"building site.\"\n\nWhy\n\nIn recent years, the Nordic welfare states have been celebrated around the world in surveys of social trust and happiness. The success of the Nordic welfare states has so far largely been studied from socioeconomic perspectives mainly focusing on this high social trust as a product of the welfare state itself. Yet, it has proven difficult for other countries to simply adopt the Nordic welfare institutions and generate higher social trust. Hence, it seems that these institutions have a longer, more complex history. Studies focusing on history, religion and culture have chiefly focused on the Social Democratic parties and the Grundtvig-influenced movements. No scholarly work has so far focused on the impact of the Modern Breakthrough on the Nordic welfare state.\n\nHow\n\nIn 5 chapters, focus will be placed on Danish literature demonstrating a continuation in debating problems and viewing the Nordic welfare project as \"unfinished.\" To show how the selected works relate to trans-Nordic debates, the case studies include Swedish comparative sources. The first two chapters stress the Georg Brandes-Henrik Pontopppidan link as a key case regarding how merging's of religious and secular aesthetics and ethics are particularly evident from the Modern Breakthrough era. The other chapters will focus on 3) social realism of the second generation of Modern Breakthrough in the inter-war period, 4) early forms of \"eco-humanism\" of the 1970s/1980s, and 5) present-day Nordic migrant poetry debating problems and pointing to the Nordic welfare state as a \"building site.\"\n\nSSR\n\nAs part of the project, I argue that the ideal of \"debating problems\" and its connection to the Protestant revival pattern of creating reformations and improvements rather than revolutions is just as essential to the development of the egalitarian Nordic welfare states as the Grundtvig-influenced movements, e.g. the Folk High School and the co-op movement which, historically, mainly focused on the class of property-owning peasants. Following the SSR principle, the project highlights the impact of the pluralistic democratic ideal of \"debating problems\" of groups such as the rural and urban proletariat, women, children, and cultural minorities. I am currently working on the first part of the project as a postdoc at Université de Strasbourg and look forward to completing it at SDU.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThis project investigates how living cells handles the occurrence of DNA breaks. In general, damage of DNA is unavoidable, and therefore it is crucial that living organisms ensures that this is not inherited through cellular generations. In this process, two of the most important elements is the physical repair of sites carrying breaks, and the regulation of cell state that ensures that cells do not pass new mutations down through generations. A key element of the repair process is the formation of small sub-compartments known as foci and in this project we will investigate how these structures can affect the concentration dynamics of important regulatory proteins, especially the extremely important transcription factor p53.\n\nWhy\n\nThe fundamental mechanisms of DNA repair have long been separated from the following regulation of transcription factors, and it is the main goal of this project to bridge these fields in order to establish a holistic picture of how living cells deal with DNA damage. It is well known that damage of DNA, introduces a broad cascade of pathways, but why the important transcription factor p53 start to shown oscillatory concentration dynamics is still not known. The link between this fingerprint in p53 behaviour, with the sudden creation of multiple foci has not been fully investigated, and thereby this project can enhance our understanding of cellular response and why this breaks down when cells pass on damaged DNA.\n\nHow\n\nI will combine the theoretical knowledge of spatiotemporal signaling and biological networks with experimental results on p53 regulation and DNA repair proteins in order to create mathematical models that can predict the relation between foci formation and p53 concentration dynamics. Through this, we can obtain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms in signaling between DNA repair and regulation. I have previously worked with p53 regulation at Harvard Medical School, and with the physical principles of DNA repair at Ecole Normale Superieure. In collaboration with experimentalists at both institutions, I will examine the link between DNA repair and regulation, and with this grant, I can pursue this fundamental idea of combining these areas.\n\nSSR\n\nThe outbreak of cancer is a major challenges to human society and understanding this is one of the scientific questions that could benefit modern society significantly. Even though the term cancer covers a broad range of diseases, a common feature is that mutations, that under normal conditions had been repaired, has been passed on through cellular generations, and in the caused uncontrolled division. Therefore, a fundamental task is to understand how cells normally ensure that these mutations are not inherited through generations and in this regard it is of particular importance that the DNA damage is both properly repaired and not passed on. This project has the potential to explain a cornerstone of this process, and with new knowledge in this field, it might be possible to find patients that are vulnerable to cancer and an earlier stage. Furthermore, understanding how repair affect the concentration of p53, could be used in future cancer diagnosis strategies.",

    "summary": "What\n\nWith recent advances in consciousness research and neuroscience, a new anthropology is emerging which calls for the development of new ideas of subjectivity, a new ethics and a 'consciousness culture'. With a focus on literary representations of selflessness, the aim of my project is to explore and develop tenable philosophical frameworks and models in response to the ethical, existential and psychological challenges this new image of man entails. The project explores the concepts, perceptions and representations of self and consciousness in Modernist, postmodern and contemporary literature that are compatible with the undermining of the notions of a centered self, free will and agency in recent empirical consciousness research, focusing in particular on the notions of dissolution of self.\n\nWhy\n\n\"The project takes on the task to identify the role of literature and the humanities in filling the normative vacuum that is appearing as subjective experience is becoming increasingly technologically accessible, and in the handling of the resulting uncertainties. It thus includes in the field of consciousness research ideas and concepts from literature and philosophy and insists on an interdisciplinary integration of research questions, methods and arguments. Thereby it consolidates this new and promising scientific discipline and bridges a gap between the natural sciences and the humanities, committing the humanities to the development of adequate theoretical and philosophical frameworks for the future of human thinking and existence.\"\n\nHow\n\nThe project looks for answers in existing ideas, investigating the literary representations of subjectivity and the mind that are compatible with the undermining of the notions of self in empirical consciousness research; and it sheds light on the connection of the literary ideas to relevant concepts in science, psychology and philosophy. Furthermore, the project outlines a new area of interdisciplinary research: consciousness culture and ethics. Recognising not only the emancipatory potential of the realisation of the illusion of free will and agency but also the existential challenges that the materialist notions of consciousness pose, the project develops philosophical positions of subjectivity for the contemporaneity and future that are compatible with the new anthropology.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project engages with the significant ethical, existential and psychological challenges and the possible sociocultural consequences that society faces as a new anthropology is emerging in the field of neuroscience and is broadly implemented culturally.",

    "title": "How does host genome determine the microbiome?",
    "summary": "What\n\nLike all other animals, we carry trillions of bacteria in and on our bodies,  collectively called the microbiome. These bacteria, however, are not just passive hitchhikers, and have profound implications for organismal health and function. They enable animals to exploit novel food sources, they influence animal behaviour and hibernation patterns, and associations with bacteria have been linked to the evolution of multicellular animals. Controlling the composition of the microbiota is therefore paramount. This project aims to establish how animals evolved to control which bacteria comprise the microbiome, and how those bacteria have evolved for a life with animals, by establishing a uniquely tractable model system for the study of host-microbiome interactions: the planarian flatworms.\n\nWhy\n\nThe composition of the microbiome is determined by complex interactions between the host's genome and environment, as well as interactions among the many bacteria. While it is clear that the host's environment is important, the role of the host itself is still hotly debated. Unpicking the effects of each component is difficult, because manipulating one aspect inadvertently impacts all others. The planarian flatworms, however, promise a novel approach for studying host-microbiome interactions that can resolve this impasse. They possess a unique stem cell system which confers them with remarkable regenerative abilities that, unlike other systems, enable manipulation of host-genotype in living animals and thereby isolation of the role of the host in determining the microbiome composition.\n\nHow\n\nThis project will exploit the planarians' unique stem cell system, together with cutting-edge sequencing technologies, to isolate the role of the host genome in controlling the microbiome. By transplanting stem cells among individual worms, we will transform the genetic identity of the host around their microbiome and follow how this affects the bacteria that comprise it. We will complement this by constructing artificial planarian microbiomes and testing how this affects worm traits-their ability to fight infections, or to adapt to novel conditions.\n\nSSR\n\nThe microbiome has important implications for both human and animal health. Understanding, therefore, how a microbiome is built and maintained, and the role the host genome plays in those processes stands to improve treatments for both. Increasing use of microbiome therapy or probiotics, for example, could benefit from a more 'personalised' approach that takes into account the host's own genome.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe way people imagine the future of the EU matters - and the fEUtures project will show how. At the heart of fEUtures is the development of a conceptual tool to map and categorise future imaginaries, that is ways in which possible futures of the EU are imagined by various actors and social groups. These imaginaries are not expressed in theoretical terms; rather they are carried, often implicitly, in the visions and narratives that people formulate, always anchored in the present. To understand the specific dimensions of these imaginaries, they need to be captured and analysed.\n\nWhy\n\nDebates invoking the future of Europe and the EU have become a veritable growth industry in policy-making and public debates. There is also a recent turn towards an engagement with future expectations and imaginaries within social sciences. Economic sociology highlights how fictional expectations drive modern economics and politics; political economy discusses the economy as a series of fictions and science fiction as a means of anticipating different economic futures. Literary fiction has fruitfully been employed side by side with social science as imaginaries for a post-capitalist future. But HOW are these futures thought about, which implications and assumptions are they based on, what are their specific conditions? fEUtures will provide ground-breaking answers to these questions.\n\nHow\n\nThe fEUtures project builds on the analysis of a corpus of material over a period of ca 15 years, covering key moments in recent processes of European integration and crisis. The material includes policy documents from key EU institutions; surveys; reports and publications from ThinkTanks and NGOs; reports and visual/recorded material from art projects on the future of Europe; literary material (books, short stories).\nThe outcome will be a monograph published with an international academic publishing house. At the same time, key findings will be made available in open access in conjunction with public events to discuss the implications of the project's main arguments.\n\nSSR\n\nThe fEUtures project sets out to to have a significant social impact by providing an accessible tool for understanding discussions about EU futures. This seems particularly pertinent in a period where the future of the European Union is contested by multiple crises. fEUtures will contribute to a better understanding of how the way we think about the future matters for politics and policies in the present.

    "summary": "What\n\nRome constitutes one of the most famous and continuously studied urban centres in the world with human activity reaching back several millennia in time. Since 2017, a Danish-Italian team has been exploring the hitherto unexcavated parts of the area most renowned for having housed the extensive public building project by Gaius Julius Caesar initiated in 46 BC, namely his public forum. Aside from its importance in the late republican and imperial periods, the location is also central to our understanding of Rome's early developments from the Recent Bronze Age onwards and for the city's development throughout Late Antiquity until the time of Mussolini, when the Via dell'Impero was laid out.The excavations have so far uncovered the historical phases at the site.\n\nWhy\n\nThe excavations are taking place on Caesar's Forum in central Rome which is a location of vital importance for Western European cultural identity. The area holds archaeological evidence covering three thousand years of Rome's prehistory and historical periods. Such a central excavation offers wide-ranging research possibilities connected to issues about the urban development of one of the Classical world's pivotal city centres. Using the latest technology and newest archaeo-science methods, the excavations on Caesar's Forum are increasing our understanding of the site's urban development as well as giving a better understanding of the site's other, previously excavated complexes.\n\nHow\n\nI am conducting my research as part of an international scientific joint venture. The excavations are undertaken as a collaboration between Sovrintendenza Capitolina ai Beni Culturali, the Danish Institute in Rome, and the Centre for Urban Network Evolutions, Aarhus University. My own contribution is taking place in Rome. Based at the Danish Institute my work is divided between the actual excavation and the ongoing research on the excavated archaeological material. I coordinate the Roman based research in collaboration with the two other directors Dr. Claudio Parisi Presicce (Sovrintendenza Capitolina ai Beni Culturali, Direzione Musei archeologici e storico-artistici) and Prof. Rubina Raja (Danish National Research Foundation's Centre of Excellence, Centre for Urban Network Evolutions).\n\nSSR\n\nTaking place at one of the most important archaeological sites in the world the excavation gives a unique possibility to apply Danish archaeological research to a scientific collaboration on the highest international level.

    "summary": "What\n\nIn this project I will study so-called antiferromagnetic spintronics. These materials have the potential to outperform present-day computing and storage technology by orders of magnitude, but only if the right materials are found. In this project, I will investigate a family of materials that has shown promising properties in this direction. Most excitingly, these materials are functional at room temperature, which is a rarity in condensed matter research. I will synthesize new members of this family of materials and investigate their spintronic properties, mainly using neutron scattering techniques. This research will deepen our understanding of antiferromagnetic spintronics and help pave the way to develop computing technology that is far superior to the current state of the art.\n\nWhy\n\nTo make use of antiferromagnetic spintronics we need a complete picture of how and why they work. The field of antiferromagnetic spintronics is still in its infancy: the spintronic properties of the family of materials I will study were discovered only 5 years ago. There are thus many open questions to be answered, and many theoretical models that are yet to be tested experimentally. Part of my project will be to test some of these models, providing theorists with data that either supports or rejects their models. In another part of my project I will synthesize new members of this family, and investigate how the properties depend on their composition. This will provide a new method to tune the spintronic properties to specific purposes.\n\nHow\n\nThis project is experimentally focused. I will synthesize the desired materials in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Oxford, and characterize and analyze the materials using standard laboratory techniques in Copenhagen.\n\nDenmark, Sweden and the rest of Europe are currently building the worlds most advanced neutron scattering source, The European Spallation Source (ESS), in Lund. This facility will yield orders of magnitude gains compared to existing facilities, and will thus push the limits of what can be measured. Using instruments at ESS I will reveal the magnetic structure and dynamics of the materials that I study.  I will use this information to uncover the secrets behind their spintronic properties.\n\nSSR\n\nThe development of e.g. Artificial Intelligence, neural networks, and analysis of \"Big Data\" all require extreme amounts of computation power and storage space. To meet these demands we need new materials.\nMy research will help pave the way for new spintronic materials that will eventually replace current hard disks, RAM and processors, offering orders of magnitude improvements in computation power and storage space.",

    "title": "With Caesar as Prism: Danish receptions of ancient Rome from the Middle Ages until today",
    "summary": "What\n\nWhile Denmark was never part of the Roman Empire, Classical culture is as much part of our cultural heritage as it is for the rest of the Western world. The project analyzes the long-term influences of Roman culture on Danish, exploiting my recent studies of the ubiquity of Caesar in Danish culture. Working from the hypothesis that the idea of long-term Greek cultural prevalence has escaped revision since it is connected to Romantic ideas still defining Danish culture, the project aims to inscribe ancient Rome as a central factor in the formation of Danish culture, as well as to set new standards for interdisciplinary research in Classics through collaborations with The Caesar's Forum Project.\n\nWhy\n\nOur understanding of Danish cultural history has long been misdirected by the common assumption that ancient Greece has had a more substantial influence on Western culture than ancient Rome. This is considered a result of Romanticism's praise of originality that devalued Roman culture due to its dependence on Greek. However, the continued impact of Latin and Roman culture through education (the Latinskole) and as the language of science has naturally left substantial marks on Danish cultural expressions, that which this project will shed light on. Its scope makes the project a milestone in research on Danish cultural history, just as the regional and chronological scope sets it out within the international research on Caesar's reception.\n\nHow\n\nPlacing itself within the theoretical framework of reception studies, the project considers the past not as a fixed Truth but a flexible entity whose meaning depends on its interpreters, thus setting out to scrutinize the active role of each interpreter or receiver. Reception studies are on the rise in Classics in Denmark and internationally, but treatments tend to focus on particular periods or cases, and, if spanning broader chronologically, to cover a scattered geographical scope and take the form of edited volumes. Objects of study are primarily textual source material, approached with a plurality of methods of philology and literary criticism. The excellent Classics environment at Oxford ensures critical dialogue on the highest expert level.\n\nSSR\n\nUncovering how regional cultural identity develops in constant dialogue with the common Classical heritage, the project offers new nuances for the current Western debate of national vs. supranational identity, also for a non-specialist readership.",

    "title": "Oceanic regime shifts and their impact on the Icelandic marine ecosystem",
    "summary": "What\n\nOwing to its geographical position, Iceland’s marine realm is influenced by heat and salt from the Atlantic Ocean, the strength and position of the Subpolar Gyre and fresh cool water flowing southward from the Arctic. This unique array of currents provides the conditions for the economically viable marine ecosystems on which Icelanders rely. This project aims to decipher the history of oceanic changes in the Iceland Basin and the impact they had on the marine ecosystem.\n\nWhy\n\nThe oceanic configuration around Iceland varies on timescales from decades to millennia and while it sustains Iceland’s marine ecosystem, it also exposes it to risks that unprecedented perturbations in these configurations may pose. Information from abrupt climatic transitions, particularly past warm periods, is key to achieve an evidence-based approach for future predictions on how the ecosystem may respond to these perturbations. This project will aim to answer the questions a) what characterises the Icelandic oceanic and ecosystem impacts of global change? and b) do changes in the Icelandic marine realm predate or lag wider shifts in oceanic regime? Additionally, in the context of rising CO2 levels, the impacts of previous periods of ocean acidification and will be explored.\n\nHow\n\nNewly recovered marine sediment cores provide a window into the past; these archives accumulate over time and contain tephra ejected from volcanoes and fossils such as foraminifera, organisms that dwell in sub-surface or bottom waters. Species have known environmental preferences and their calcium carbonate shells contain the geochemical fingerprint of the water in which they lived, making both qualitative (e.g. the water masses present) and quantitative (e.g. temperature and salinity) reconstructions possible. Foraminifera can be dated and will be used in conjunction with tephra layers of known age to provide a precise timeline of change in Iceland’s oceanic conditions and ecosystem, essential for assessing the impact of wider oceanic and atmospheric regimes back through time.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project contributes to the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute research priority of climate variations and effects on the ecosystems and will provide paleo-data to inform efforts toward achieving the UN 2030 SDG 14: Life Below Water.",

    "title": "Selective and traceless release of truncated CRISPR Cas9 guide RNA for anti-cancer gene editing in NSCLC cells",
    "summary": "What\n\nIn this project, the gene editing CRISPR/Cas9 system will be used to disable lung cancer cells in a laboratory setting. The gene editing will be directed by a synthetic guide RNA sequence that will be optimised by comparing the effect of many such compounds with subtle modifications. \nWhen several highly active RNAs have been developed, they will be conjugated to a carrier system that will ensure delivery to cancer cell. The carrier system is based on cell penetrating peptides that will be optimised to target the cancer cells.\nThe final conjugates are expected to deliver more than 50% of the RNA in a 24 period and suppress the cancer cells at least three times more effective than current guide RNA.\n\nWhy\n\nGene editing holds huge promise as treatment for human diseases such as cancer. In order to realize this potential, several challenges first have to be solved. Ensuring that the developed drugs reach the cancer cells and the correct targets within the cells is one of those challenges. \nThis is challenging because the bimolecular drugs are relatively large and unstable compared to traditional small molecule drugs that require less or no assistance in reaching their site of action.\nThis project can provide new tools to direct bimolecular drugs for gene edition and is therefore an important part of the further development of gene editing technology as a whole.\n\nHow\n\nThe experimental plan for this project will begin by optimizing the guide RNA that directs the gene editing. The RNA will be chemically modified to ensure stability and increase function. Sequencing will be used to show that the targeted cancer genes are successfully disabled and to what extent off-target genes are damaged. \nNext, the carrier peptides will be optimized to transport the guide RNA into lung cancer cells. Fluorophores will be used to track the compounds and visualize how they enter the cell.\nOnce suitable pairs of guide RNAs and peptides have been identified, they will be connected in such a way that the RNA can be released inside the cell and exert the cancer disruptive function.\n\nSSR\n\nThe impact that gene editing will have on society is hard to predict but is likely to be significant. Because of this, it is important to establish safe and reliable methods that will allow gene editing to be used responsibly. Cancer likewise has a large impact on society and still require new developments in treatment. This project has the potential to create new knowledge in areas and can therefore eventually lead to direct value for society.",

    "title": "Skriften på væggen - epigrafikkens rolle i middelalderens skriftkultur i Danmark ca. 1050-1350",
    "summary": "What\n\nProjektet handler om den brede befolknings evne til at læse og skrive i Danmark (inkl. Skånelandene) i tiden ca. 1050‒1350. Det er velkendt, at bogproduktionen foregik blandt lærde specialister, men vi ved meget lidt om den almene befolknings læring, håndtering og brug af skrift. Derfor tager undersøgelsen afsæt i epigrafikken, dvs. indskrifter på genstande, monumenter og bygninger, for her er flere samfundslag repræsenteret end i bogkulturen. Landets kirker er de eneste bygninger, der er bevaret fra middelalderen og til i dag. På kirkernes vægge står middelalderens tekster lige for øjnene af os, og de udgør nogle af de dybeste rødder for den håndskrift, som er ved at forsvinde i dag.\n\nWhy\n\nTraditionelt har forskningen i ældre middelalders skriftkultur været optaget af bogstavernes og bogens indtog i Danmark efter kristendommens indførelse, og der har været fokus på gejstlighedens og de lærdes skriftproduktion på pergament. Epigrafikken har spillet en perifer rolle i denne diskussion og har på sin side været præget af et ensidigt, filologisk fokus på runeindskrifterne alene samt deres læsning og tolkning, mens samspillet mellem runer og bogstaver samt indskrifternes betydning for det middelalderlige samfund ikke har været studeret. Dette projekt, som knytter epigrafik og filologi sammen med arkæologi, teologi og historie i et tværfagligt studium, yder derfor et væsentligt bidrag til en helstøbt forståelse af middelalderens skriftkultur.\n\nHow\n\nProjektet går helt tæt på det enkelte menneskes rolle i skriftproduktionen for at kunne diskutere den kollektive anvendelse af skrift og hører nøje sammen med det engelske begreb literacy, som anvendes i den tværfaglige udforskning af fortidige skriftkulturer. Eftersom indskrifterne forekommer på bygninger eller på genstande og monumenter, som har en anden funktion ud over at være brugt til at skrive på, undersøges indskrifterne ud fra omgivelserne. Arkæologien og kirkerummets arkitektur og indretning hjælper med at forstå mængden af indskrifter, og hvor menigheden opholdt sig, og disse undersøgelser spiller sammen med den viden vi har om middelalderens liturgi, og hvad der foregik i kirkerummet. Analysen foretages inden for rammen af vores viden om middelalderens samfundskultur.\n\nSSR\n\nFra socialantropologiske studier ved vi, at skriftens væsentligste rolle er fastholdelsen af det talte ord, så den skriftlige kommunikation til en vis grad udvisker afstand i både tid og rum. Derfor griber dette studie af middelalderens skriftkultur også ind i den (aftagende) brug af skrift, som det moderne samfund er på vej imod, og vi får mulighed for at tage stilling til vores egen brug af skrift med afsæt i historisk viden.",

    "title": "Catalytic Enantioselective 1,2-Rearrangements Using Lewis Base Catalysis",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe aim of the project is to develop an efficient organo-catalytic methodology for the enantioselective [1,2]-rearrangement of allylic ammonium ylides in the formation of amino acids. \nThe project will involve the development of new catalysts to promote this transformation. Furthermore, once the method is optimized, the mechanism will be elucidated to give an even better insight into this important reaction.\n\nWhy\n\nAmino acids are one of the fundamental building blocks of life. For this reason, they play an essential role in both medicine and science. This method allows for a straightforward synthesis of amino acids from simple starting materials, generating chiral centers and C-C bonds in the process. Moreover, it explores a significant and recognized challenge in organic chemistry. Contrary to the [1,2], the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement is a well-known reaction. A challenge of this project will be to favor the [1,2]-rearrangement over the [2,3]-rearrangement, allowing for a much wider scope for these transformations.\n\nHow\n\nThe project will be carried out in collaboration with Prof. Andrew Smith from the University of St Andrews. Prof. Smith and his team are expert in organo-catalysis, using BTM as a catalyst. Building on previous results using BTM to promote the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic ammonium ylides, BTM analogues will be synthesized and optimized for properties to promote the [1,2]-rearrangement. Furthermore, it will be investigated which structural motifs will bias towards the [1,2]-rearrangement. With this knowledge in hand, the reaction will be fine-tuned by applying meticulous optimization of temperature, reaction time, solvent, and additives. This in turn is expected to yield a well performing reaction of allylic ammonium ylides to amino acids by a [1,2]-rearrangement.\n\nSSR\n\nThe amino acid structure is an essential motif for the chemical industry and research in general. By developing new and improved ways of synthesizing this motif we not only make it cheaper to produce medicine and other fine chemicals, but we also broaden the scope of what motifs are easily accessible, and therefore useful to the chemical industry. This in turn leads to a more sustainable industry and a medical/chemical industry with more possibilities when developing new medicine or fine chemicals. BTM is one of the few organo-catalysts that has found industrial application. By employing this catalyst, we hope to reduce the need for transition metal catalysts making a more environmentally friendly chemical industry a possibility.",

    "title": "Exploring Young Childrens Agency in Everyday Transitions",
    "summary": "What\n\nFrom a very young age, children are part of multiple activities and relations within and across everyday life contexts (e.g. family, daycare). In the monograph I employ a relational research strategy by observing children (age 1-5) in these everyday life contexts to catch children's perspectives and to explore children's agency in and across social situations. Hence, the aim is twofold: to 1) develop ground-breaking theoretical understandings of children's agency and subjectivity in relation to daily transitions within and across everyday life contexts, and 2) to problematize that concerns for children's developmental conditions are often being assessed without considering children's concrete everyday life conditions or including their perspectives.\n\nWhy\n\nThe monograph contributes with ground-breaking knowledge on children's development and well-being. In psychology, marginalization have been studied as a results of risk factors. Hence, problems in children's lives are often being assessed by associating isolated variables such as child behavior and parental resources/deficits to a prospective outcome. It is crucial to develop new ways of thinking about children in marginalized positions since the complexity of everyday living comprise children's developmental conditions. The monograph contributes with a focus on children's agentic ways of participating in and moving between everyday life contexts. This focus enables analysis of the situated meanings of marginalization and why children relate differently to adversities.\n\nHow\n\nI draw on empirical data from long-term participant observations of 5 children (1-5) in their everyday life contexts. By taking a point of departure in cultural-historical research traditions I am able to  emphasize how children are active subjects in their own lives. This theoretical framework is fruitful for gaining a comprehensive approach to the study of children. Hence, taking a point of departure in cultural-historical traditions allows for developing novel understandings of how social problems, adversity and conflicts in children's lives are interconnected with their participation in a compound everyday life across contexts  and within a multiplicity of social relations (e.g. other children in day care settings, parents, caregivers, siblings).\n\nSSR\n\nThe monograph aims to develop theoretical knowledge also relevant for professional practice. For instance, in child protection services professionals are obliged to take children's perspectives into consideration in the handling of children's cases. However, including preverbal children's perspectives often are considered a challenge in professional work. The monograph offers novel understandings of young children in marginalized positions by focusing on their ways of participating in and across everyday life contexts. I show how it is possible to approach children's perspectives precisely by focusing on their activities in daily living. In this way, the monograph contributes with knowledge relevant for qualifying the professional work with young, preverbal and marginalized children by 1) offering ways to include these children's perspectives, 2) providing a more complex framework for understanding the situated meanings and consequences of marginalization. In this way, the knowledge produced enables processes of inclusion of marginalized groups and often neglected voices in society.",

    "title": "The Sound of the Silent Majority in Energy Transitions: the Power of Resistance vs. Acceptance",
    "summary": "What\n\nOpinion polls readily document support for renewable energy technologies (RETs), e.g. wind farms. Yet, local RETs are often a source of social and political controversy, and stories of resistance to local RETs repeatedly make the headlines. However, to what extent do these RET-related debates capture the complete package of stakeholder views on the matter? Research suggests that the public debate is biased towards the RET resistance, while the more silent majority support attracts little attention. This research explores the socio-psychological underpinnings, and the power, of the emotions triggered by local RET-related change among stakeholders. It also explores how these emotions inform the public debate related to the large-scale renewable infrastructure planning and deployment.\n\nWhy\n\nWe know that transitions to renewable energy resources depend on technical as well as social and political factors. This research focuses on the social perspectives of energy transitions. The research will creatively combine and synthesize research insights from particularly the social psychology and energy transitions bodies of knowledge. This transdisciplinary perspective on energy transitions contributes to bridging the knowledge-gap between research on public reactions to local land use change caused by renewable energy technologies, the social psychology of emotions, and public perceptions of climate change issues.\n\nHow\n\nThis transdisciplinary social science research enquiry will draw upon mixed qualitative data and quantitative data. This mixed methods research enquiry may comprise some anthropological fieldwork, interviews, survey data and document analysis.  \nThe research results will be published in academic journals and in popular media.\n\nSSR\n\nSocial and political controversy associated with the planning and deployment of large-scale renewable energy infrastructures is a key challenge for the necessary transitions to renewable energy resources. Such controversy may not necessarily go away. However, insights into their socio-psychological underpinnings may facilitate better planning processes for all. \nThe public debate mirrors the power and influence of resistance versus acceptance, of good versus bad. Exploring this phenomenon may explain how and to what extent. It may also reveal how much - or little - we listen to those informed by more relaxed and quiet positive emotions. The research will comply with the international values and standards of good scientific practice as defined by The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity.",

    "title": "Probabilistic numerics for high dimensional tasks",
    "summary": "What\n\nMy project is about giving numerical methods a probabilistic treatment. This means that methods such as gradient descent and numerical integration, which are used to find optimal solutions to difficult tasks, can begin to assert their approximation error. These methods only get more difficult when we move into high dimensions, in the sense of problems with thousands of variables and parameters. In detail, my project aims to advance probabilistic numerics in high dimensions.\n\nWhy\n\nSo much of modern statistics and scientific computing involve numerical methods for optimization, integration, or basic linear algebra. Mostly, we trust these to be precise and forget their associated errors. However, if these methods are parts of a larger computational pipeline their errors can propagate and the consequences can be dramatic with much too overconfident models.\n\nBeyond this, Bayesian optimization (a branch of probabilistic numerics) provides guarantees of global optimization, as opposed to gradient descent algorithms, thus there is even room to improve the performance of modern solvers.\n\nHow\n\nIn high dimensions, most of the intuitive behaviour we know from 2 and 3 dimensions fall apart. To build algorithms that recognize this it will be important to understand these differences mathematically and statistically.\n\nSome models, such as neural networks, are built with gradient descent in mind. Thus, another element of the project will be looking for new models that potentially could be built with probabilistic numerics at the computational level.\n\nSSR\n\nThere is no doubt that artificial intelligence will continue to invade our everyday lives. The need for principled algorithms that can assert their own uncertainties is crucial for the trustworthy future deployment of artificial intelligence.",

    "title": "Virtual Library of Torfæus: Manuscripts of Old Norse Texts Owned by the Royal Historiographer Thormodus Torfæus",
    "summary": "What\n\nThormod Torfæus (1636-1719), an Icelander serving as royal antiquarian at the Danish court, owned a collection of Old Norse manuscripts, which after his death ended up in the collection of Árni Magnússon, who divided almost all these manuscripts into smaller units. Because of Magnússon's rearrangement activities and the agreement between Iceland and Denmark about the division of his collection, manuscripts which used to be in a single codex in Torfæus' library, today survive in many parts held in two countries. Therefore, their contents can no longer be seen in their entirety. My project employs the latest tools in digital preservation and cataloging to restore the dispersed manuscripts, and to make accessible, for the first time, the library of this important scholar to wider audiences.\n\nWhy\n\nTorfæus examined the Old Norse sagas as historical sources and commented extensively on various historical and cultural aspects of these texts in the margins of his manuscripts. This project analyses these sagas and the marginal annotations that accompany them in the context of virtually reconstructed manuscripts in order to answer research questions considering Torfæus' working methods as a historian, book collector, and commissioner. Torfæus' marginalia are valuable sources for the history of early modern Danish historiography, but they have hitherto remained unanalyzed, due to the dispersed state of his collection. This project is the first study of the entire corpus of his annotations which will provide insight into the early modern processes of knowledge creation and classification.\n\nHow\n\nThis project expands upon traditional philological analysis with codicological examination of physical artefacts and innovative digital tools and methods applied to expand our knowledge and understanding of early modern scholarship. A basis of the project will be an Open Access database of Torfæus' manuscripts, which will include manuscript descriptions and virtual reconstructions of selected manuscripts. The digital encoding of the marginal annotations will enable me to develop analytical framework for the data classification, which will shed new light on the reception of Old Norse literature in early modern Denmark. Collaboration with the specialists from world-leading research institutes in Europe, UK, and the US, will assure necessary support to successfully conduct this project.\n\nSSR\n\nTorfæus, on request of king Frederik III, was the first to compile the oldest Danish royal genealogy based on Old Norse sources, which contradicted the traditional succession presented by Saxo. By doing that, Torfæus influenced the Danish perception of Old Norse-Icelandic material, which eventually became part of the Danish literary canon, so that even today Danish high school students read works such as the Poetic Edda and Njáls saga, as a part of their education. Considering the long-lasting reception of Old Norse literature in Denmark, it is culturally important to engage critically with the origins of enquiry into Old Norse sagas in Denmark and its important role in conceptualizing Danish national history.",

    "title": "The Missionary Dictionary: Native Words, Spanish Concepts, and Pre-Hispanic 'Paganism'",
    "summary": "What\n\nWords are gateways to history-although not always to the history we know. When 16th-century missionaries set out to Christianize indigenous American peoples in the Spanish Empire, the dictionary was their key tool for fusing two previously isolated hemispheres. Using Antonio de Nebrija's Spanish-to-Latin dictionary as a model for their own dictionaries, the missionaries tended to translate from Latin and Spanish to indigenous languages. This working order reflected the task of conversion, which required Christian terms and texts to be translated. But did the missionary dictionaries of indigenous languages record or produce the non-Christian religious terms they indexed? Examining Nahuatl and Quechua dictionaries and texts (1540-1615), this question guides the Missionary Dictionary project.\n\nWhy\n\nScholarship on pre-Hispanic America draws increasingly on source materials written in indigenous languages in an attempt to understand indigenous social and conceptual worlds and deter colonialist representations found in Spanish source texts. This endeavor relies on the handy tool of the missionary dictionary. Yet, this was not a mere recording device, but also a missionary venue for reshaping semantic landscapes. New knowledge of the missionary dictionary as a historical source material and genre born from Nebrija's Spanish-Latin dictionary is thus needed. By critically scrutinizing missionary dictionaries and their processes of production, this project enables a methodological reconsideration of colonial sources on pre-Hispanic religion set to change our views of pre-Hispanic society.\n\nHow\n\nThe Missionary Dictionary project systematically compares religious terminology in Nebrija's Latin-to-Spanish dictionary with religious terminology in missionary Nahuatl and Quechua dictionaries. It furthermore analyzes how that terminology was used in colonial Spanish, Nahuatl, and Quechua texts focused on portraying pre-Hispanic religious life. With this approach, the project explores how pre-existing Euro-Christian conceptions of 'paganism' might have served to reconceptualize the pre-Hispanic past in colonial society.\n\nSSR\n\nBy identifying how missionaries reframed pre-colonial indigenous history and religion through linguistic intervention per medium of the dictionary, the project will uncover historical injustices of European imperialism that reverberate in the present and, as advocated by the UN, assist in clearing pathways for indigenous peoples in Hispanic America to access their history.",

    "title": "Soil carbon feedbacks to reintroduction of large herbivores in Arctic landscapes: Decelerating climate warming?  - HERBIVARC",
    "summary": "What\n\nIntroduction of large herbivores in ecosystems where they are currently extirpated is a way of restoring natural ecosystem dynamics. Large animals effectively increase the landscape variation and in turn biodiversity. However, how large animals influence other ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage, is not well understood. Dragging carbon out of the atmosphere and into biomass in vegetation and soils is often highlighted as a promising strategy for reducing climate warming. However, in Arctic tundra carbon is currently being released to the atmosphere, particularly due to warmer soils. HERBIVARC studies the potential of large herbivores to decelerate this release of C from soils to the atmosphere by stabilising the carbon in the soil.\n\nWhy\n\nOver the last few decades, our knowledge about Arctic ecosystem responses to climate warming has increased exponentially. Yet, the role of large herbivores in regulating interactions between vegetation and soils and the combined impact on climate feedbacks remains poorly explored. Soils are  important global carbon (C) stores, and as the Arctic region warms about 4 times faster than the global average, the Arctic soil C-pool is currently being released to the atmosphere as greenhouse gasses. Introduction of large herbivores may have the ability to decelerate this trend, partly through increasing the soil C-input and -stabilisation. HERBIVARC will elucidate changes in soil C-dynamics caused by herbivore introduction in the tundra and estimate its potential for climate change mitigation.\n\nHow\n\nIn 1996, an assembly of large herbivores including bison, yakutian horses and reindeer were introduced into an area called the Pleistocene Park (PP) in Northeastern Siberia. This experiment has created a unique opportunity to study the effects of herbivores on ecosystem dynamics on timescales relevant for climate change. In HERBIVARC, we will combine field-based estimates of greenhouse gas effluxes from soils inside and outside the PP. Moreover, we will take soil samples for studying soil C-mobilisation and -stabilisation under laboratory conditions. We will explore the potential biological drivers of the changes soil C dynamics by quantifying the changes in soil faunal and microbial communities associated with large herbivore introduction.\n\nSSR\n\nHERBIVARC will shed light on the promises of large herbivore introduction in the Arctic as a strategy for decelerating climate warming. Rewilding and ecosystem restoration is by both the UN and EU deemed one of the most promising techniques for contributing to solving both the biodiversity and climate crisis at the same time. While the positive effects on biodiversity seems unequivocal, the acclaimed climate mitigation potential is yet to be confirmed by scientific evaluations. HERBIVARC will provide important new knowledge about this aspect of one of the most debated restoration techniques. If introduction of large herbivores proves effective for reducing soil C-loss, rewilding may be considered a natural climate solution, which is not only relevant in the vulnerable Arctic landscape, but across the world were rewilding projects are increasing dramatically in abundance.",

    "title": "Novel strategies for concurrent gene delivery to central and peripheral organs",
    "summary": "What\n\nMy research focuses on gene therapy, which is based on delivery of therapeutic genes to the relevant tissue and organs in the body. Therapeutic genes can correct inherited diseases or ameliorate pathologies that develop later in life. Gene therapy can be given as a one-time treatment to provide long-lasting benefits, which is especially promising for diseases that can persist for decades or even for life. \n\nFor therapeutic genes to exert their beneficial effects they must be delivered to the affected part of the body. This delivery is especially challenging in diseases affecting multiple organs, including the brain. The goal of my project is to develop novel strategies to safely and efficiently achieve simultaneous delivery of genes to multiple organs and several parts of the brain.\n\nWhy\n\nGene delivery to multiple organs, and especially to several parts of the brain, remains an unmet need for many devastating disorders. My project will provide a platform to advance scientific fields related to gene therapy and propel forward the possibilities to deliver treatments across the human body and for a broad range of diseases. This will allow for the development of long-lasting treatments for diseases that currently have no cure. The gene delivery can be modified for specific needs for the individual treatments and be tailored for widespread gene delivery to organs, including the brain, or focus on efficient delivery to multiple or single brain regions.\n\nHow\n\nGene delivery to organs, except the brain, are easily achieved by a simple intravenous injection of gene carriers. A major obstacle for gene delivery to the brain is the blood-brain-barrier, which only allows few substances to pass from the blood into the brain. I will overcome this barrier by using transcranial focused ultrasound and microbubbles injected in the blood. The interaction between the ultrasound waves and the microbubbles circulating in the blood vessels of the brain causes a temporary increase in the ability of gene carriers to travel from the blood into the brain.\n\nI will conduct this project at Sunnybrook Research Institute in Toronto, Canada. Sunnybrook is recognized as 1 of only 8 Centre of Excellence in Focused Ultrasound in the world.\n\nSSR\n\nThe ability to deliver genes to multiple organs and several brain regions with a single treatment can lead to therapeutic efficacy for a broad range of disorders. Gene therapy can provide lasting benefits for people suffering from inherited and acquired diseases that require life-long treatments. For example, my research includes delivery strategies that can lead to effective treatments for people living with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, for which there is no cure. The methods developed within the scope of my project can be combined with novel and pre-existing therapeutics; which we are developing and investigating with industry partners, respectively. Promising compounds can only reach therapeutic efficacy provided that sufficient delivery is achieved.",

    "title": "Lutheran legacy in Danish society in a longue durée perspective. Household, authority and social responsibility",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe religious roots of contemporary western and non-western societies play a key role in national and international political, societal, and cultural debates, but these debates seldom build on historical knowledge. Simultaneously, the Nordic countries are subject to international attention due to their welfare systems, solidly founded trust culture, and focus on gender equality. This monograph investigates Lutheran legacy as a vital part of Danish societal development and offers a new explanation of the basis for modern Danish society. It does so through focussing on an examination and analysis of authority and social responsibility in the early modern household as a central institution for state-building and on the transformation of household authority into citizenship.\n\nWhy\n\nThe impact of Lutheranism on Danish society is often addressed either by Reformation Studies, which focus on the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, or by welfare-state studies, which focus on the twentieth century. This monograph will, however, establish a vital bridge between these two traditions and give insights into path dependencies in the religious impact on society. Max Weber's work on Protestant ethics has been the key influence on studies of European societies' religious roots. As a result, the term \"Protestantism\" often implies a focus on the reformed tradition central to Weber's work. Through empirical studies from Danish contexts, this monograph will produce new knowledge about the societal impact of Protestantism and new understandings of the Lutheran Protestant ethic.\n\nHow\n\nThe book will introduce a new theoretical concept of confessional societies. This concept captures long-term historical influences coming from the realm of religion through the interplay between confessional influence on various levels in society (political, legal, childhood teaching in church and every day practices) not normally studied together. The interdisciplinary analysis combines political, legal, and cultural history with theology and will lead to empirical knowledge of the religious roots of present-day societies. The research will draw on numerous and multi-faceted sources as theological writings and catechisms, legislation, court records, petitions, and administrative correspondence from different segments of Danish society as well as parliamentary debates, and newspapers.\n\nSSR\n\nIn order to understand religious and cultural conflicts of contemporary societies, it is important to understand history as formed by more than material and social factors. This book will deliver an empirically founded argument for the impact of the Lutheran legacy on the formation of modern Denmark. It will challenge theories of secularisation by elucidating the ongoing religious legacy within modern Western democracies and in societal institutions that we tend to understand as objective, neutral, and transferrable - such as welfare systems, citizens' rights, and even notions of democracy itself. This has the potential of generating crucial debates about secularization processes and the entanglement between religion and society even in societies, which we consider highly secularized.",

    "title": "Cultural Roots of Economic Development: Evidence from Scandinavia",
    "summary": "What\n\nWhat drives long-term economic growth? This is one of the most fundamental questions in economics. A growing body of research suggest the importance of a factor long ignored by economists: Culture. Studies on this topic aim to establish if and how cultural traits like trust, individualism, and gender roles shape economic development over time. A key empirical challenge is however the lack of adequate historical cultural indicators. This inhibits the study of culture over longer time periods and the identification of causal relationships.\n\nWith novel databases I will study the role of culture in Scandinavian economic development in the period 1700-1900. In this time period, the Scandinavian countries transformed from poor, agricultural societies to some of the world's richest nations.\n\nWhy\n\nCultural norms help individuals make decisions in complex environments where figuring out the optimal action is often very costly. A question then is if cultural differences hold the power to shape economic outcomes across societies. Research has documented strong associations between culture and contemporary economic outcomes across societies. These correlations do however not imply causal relationships. To fully understand if and how cultural norms shape economic development over time, a historical perspective (and data) is necessary.\n\nHow\n\nMy research relies on population censuses and church records from the 18th and 19th centuries. With this data I can study important economic choices of millions of Scandinavians and examine if they were shaped by local cultural norms. For instance, it is commonly believed that a rising culture of individualism in Europe fostered economic development by encouraging mobility and innovation. This idea has however never been empirically tested in large scale databases. I bridge this gap with novel indicators of cultural identity from properties of first names and family patterns, which are unique in their scope and detail.\n\nSSR\n\nMy research will uncover determinants and consequences of economic development that have so far been neglected in public debates and policy work. If cultural norms matter for the way in which a country develops, then this needs to be taken into account, when designing development strategies in different parts of the world.",

    "title": "Wars, Pandemics, and the Human Mind: Competing Conceptions of Trauma in the 21st Century",
    "summary": "What\n\nThis project explores the science and politics of trauma in the 21st century. The official psychiatric model of trauma known as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) currently defines how western societies perceive and treat the psychological effects of shock and violence. But since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the PTSD model has been challenged by new and different understandings of trauma. Two competing scientific vocabularies of \"resilience\" and \"moral injury\" now vie to provide an alternative to the psychiatric model of trauma. Yet the reasons why trauma is being reframed today-and the larger social and political implications of this change-are poorly understood; investigating them requires scholarship beyond the psychological sciences themselves.\n\nWhy\n\nThe work on \"resilience\" and \"moral injury\" has occurred in isolation from each other, and the research on moral injury has taken place mostly within the closed circles of clinical psychology and psychiatry. But these concepts need to be considered together in a broader context, as part of a larger challenge to the western understanding of trauma. Our project combines perspectives from science studies, psychology, and the philosophy of science to analyze the use of \"resilience\" and \"moral injury\" in Europe and the United States over the last two decades. The result will be a rich empirical account and a comprehensive theoretical appraisal of the way trauma is governed today in relation to armed conflicts, humanitarian crises, and global emergencies like the ongoing pandemic.\n\nHow\n\nThe project is divided into three case studies. The U.S. to a large extent sets the global agenda for trauma research; case study 1 looks at how \"resilience\" and \"moral injury\" have reshaped the American mental health establishment's thinking on trauma since 9/11. The case study focuses on the scientific debates and politics surrounding these concepts in both military and civilian contexts. Case study 2 explores how the concepts are being taken up by humanitarian organizations working in the field of conflicts and catastrophes. Case study 3 looks at how notions of resilience and moral injury affect the way specialists and policymakers perceive the psychological effects of traumatic events in civilian healthcare in the front-line response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSSR\n\nSince the late 19th century, the psychological sciences have helped turn the individual experience\nof trauma into a concern of the state. The scientific understanding of trauma raises moral, economic, and political questions for state and society. Who is responsible for the suffering? Who should be compensated? Can traumatization be prevented? This project will produce empirical and theoretical insights into how trauma is understood and governed today, as well as critical reflections on how the psychological sciences shape the way societies understand and try to manage the human effects of extreme events.",

    "title": "Economizing Science and National Identities: The Royal Greenland Trading Department and the Making of Modern Denmark and Greenland",
    "summary": "What\n\nSince its foundation in 1774, the Royal Greenlandic Trading Department (KGH) has played a crucial role in shaping Greenlandic-Danish relations. Through its monopoly on trade, the KGH not only controlled the flow of goods to and from Greenland, but also Greenland's administration, while simultaneously seeking to further Denmark's economic, scientific, and cultural interests in the Arctic region. However, the KGH's position within the Arctic has been historically problematic. The aim of this project is to reassess the significance of the trading company in constructing modern Greenlandic and Danish national identities, through three main themes: 1) 'Money' including trade and economics; 2) 'Knowledge' including science and exploration; and 3) 'Culture' including law and people.\n\nWhy\n\nThrough its control over the flow of goods to and from Greenland, the KGH shaped the livelihoods of both Greenlanders and Danish settlers in Greenland. In addition, the KGH also traded in knowledge and scientific specimens, and the science produced in Greenland shaped Danish and international perceptions of Greenlanders, as well as perceptions of Denmark as a colonial state. The KGH's trade monopoly was dismantled in 1950, which was one of several transformative moments in Greenland and Denmark's shared history. Yet, the legacies of the monopoly trade are still felt today, in complex ways. This project will interrogate the history and legacy of the trading company, thereby offering a new and timely contribution to our understanding of Danish colonialism and Danish-Greenlandic relations.\n\nHow\n\nThis project combines insights from Arctic studies, history of science, intellectual history, and museum studies, to interrogate how objects and scientific knowledge travelled across national boundaries. The data for this project consists of written sources and cultural objects, which are held in Aarhus, Copenhagen, Nuuk, and Upernavik. The textual sources includes the KGH's administrative files, private letters and diaries, and published articles and books. Material sources includes art, fur products, food, transport and hunting equipment, and specimens of natural history. In combining such textual and material archives, this project interrogates how the monopoly trade, including the trade in objects and scientific knowledge, shaped all aspects of Greenlandic life.\n\nSSR\n\nGreenland-Denmark relations are at a crucial turning point, and this project will therefore contribute to the wider discourses on the past and future relationship between the two nations. The legacies of the KGH's trade monopoly fundamentally shaped both Greenland and Denmark, though in different ways. The commodity goods and scientific specimens imported from Greenland shaped Danish understandings of the Arctic. In Greenland, the trade influenced everything from its physical infrastructure, including the establishment of villages, and the legal system, to the availability of food and fuel. Because of this high level of social impact, I have designed the project to have an outreach and consultation component, which will be directed towards and include broad non-specialist audiences.",

    "title": "Evaluating the Efficiency of Electoral Rights under the European Convention: A Cross-Regime Perspective",
    "summary": "What\n\nMy project will study how the European Convention of Human Rights affects the state of democracy in the continent. Almost all European countries are parties to the Convention. It obliges them to hold free elections to parliament that would reflect their citizens' opinion. At first glance, there is nothing to worry about as all the countries in question do hold legislative elections. Yet, there are reasons to believe that in some states the elections are not free and do not reflect popular opinion. Consequently, there is a growing number of election cases at the European Court of Human Rights. My project aims to determine how the resulting judgments affect legislation and conduct of elections.\n\nWhy\n\nPolitical science scholarship suggests that elections have different meanings, depending on the context. In a functioning democracy, leaders are ready to accept their defeat at the polls and give up power. However, this not the case in many countries. Instead, rulers use a variety of tricks to minimize their chance of losing power. Consequently, elections are run in conditions that are far from an even playing field. Therefore, political scientists distinguish between distinct types of political regimes, depending on their attitude towards elections. Legal scholarship, despite its growing interest in international democratic rights, is yet to integrate the distinctions between political regimes. My project will bridge this disciplinary gap between law and political science.\n\nHow\n\nThe project will measure the impact of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the field of elections on countries with different political regimes. It will achieve that goal by investigating both the black-letter law and perceptions of the relevant stakeholders from the focus countries - Denmark, Finland, and several states of Central and Eastern Europe. The legal analysis will concentrate on election legislation and case-law of national courts. The perception will be gauged on the basis of interviews with judges, election administrators, and representatives of the non-governmental organizations.\n\nSSR\n\nToday the idea of electoral democracy is becoming increasingly contested. Aspiring authoritarians routinely deny a level playing field to their potential competitors. In established democracies, growing discontent leads to civic disengagement and claims of electoral irregularities. For a researcher, this means that democracy must be understood as a work in progress that requires further investigation of its basic features. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider a democratic contribution to addressing Grand Challenges, particularly by empowering marginalized groups. The project's interdisciplinary lens means that it will go beyond doctrinal law and engage in complex societal issues at the root of disputes in the courtroom. The comparative angle of the project will introduce perspectives that may be otherwise ignored. The project would not offer a ready solution for the current challenges facing electoral democracy. Rather, it can help better understand those challenges and equip policymakers facing them.",

    "title": "Scalable Quantum Coupling of Silicon-Donor Spin Qubits",
    "summary": "What\n\nQuantum technologies and quantum computing are predicted to have revolutionary applications, by solving problems that are otherwise intractable even for the fastest classical supercomputers. A genuine quantum advantage, however, requires manufacturing and interconnecting millions of high-quality quantum bits. This project aims to demonstrate a scalable platform for coupling donor-based silicon qubits over long distances, providing the backbone for scaling up silicon-based quantum computers, as well as a rich platform for fundamental quantum science.\n\nWhy\n\nA fault-tolerant universal quantum computer is expected to consist of millions of high-quality quantum bits (qubits). A promising route is to adapt the manufacturing methods of the existing silicon nanoelectronic industry - capable of producing chips with billions of nanometer-scale silicon transistors at very low cost - to create spin-based qubits in silicon. For example, dopant atoms, commonly used to tune the electronic properties of semiconductors, act as natural two-level qubit systems.\n\nHow\n\nTo achieve long-range coupling of donor-based qubits, I plan to develop resonator system that is compatible with the existing silicon spin qubits. This is the first step in achieving a coupling between the spin of the qubit system and photons in the resonators, which will allow coherent coupling of spatially separated qubits.\nIn achieving this, I can take advantage of my previous experience in developing high quality, magnetic field-resilient resonators for hybrid superconducting/semiconducting systems. Combined with the existing efforts in the group and\nthe state-of-the-art nanofabrication facilities, I believe this can be achieved in the given timeframe.\n\nSSR\n\nQuantum technologies may be useful in finding new medical drugs, energy solutions or fertilisers by potentially allowing complex molecule simulations. This may open new directions, both commercially and in education with positive social implications.",

    "summary": "What\n\nShared research facilities constitute the meeting point of diverse minds. At the Niels Bohr Institute (NBI), condensed-matter researchers in materials growth, nanofabrication, and quantum device engineering work with industrial partners (Microsoft Quantum, QDevil ApS, Sparrow Quantum) to develop tomorrow's quantum platforms. This project enables a shared cryogenic screening setup capable of characterizing a wide variety of quantum devices down to low temperatures (0.1 kelvin). The infrastructure acquired will include a state-of-the-art low-temperature cryostat for multi-channel low- and high-frequency electrical measurements. The aim is to enable rapid, high-throughput, low-temperature characterization, a roadblock for quantum researchers.\n\nWhy\n\nThe synthesis of dissimilar materials, such as metallic superconductors matched to semiconductors, has led to hybrid devices with hitherto unseen quantum properties, enabling the exploration of fundamental condensed matter physics and the creation of complex devices for quantum-technology applications. Hybrid devices exhibit high-frequency behaviour accessible only at sub-kelvin temperatures. A tremendous productivity increase will be gained for solid-state phycisists by having access to rapid cryogenic characterization of newly synthesized quantum materials and freshly patterned (multi-terminal) quantum devices. The shared tool will also benefit the study of fragile, exotic materials that \"age\" quickly, and generally ignite the creativity of quantum device pioneers in Denmark.\n\nHow\n\nWe will commission a cryogenic setup comprising pulse-tube coolers, automatic adiabatic demagnetization coolers, and a vacuum load lock to achieve rapid cycle times for a wide variety of quantum devices down to temperatures as low as 0.1 K. Sample holders will be customized to allow a smooth and safe cycle of samples between critical stages of device development; from fabrication via sample screening to the eventual operation of optimized devices in existing dilution refrigerators (below 0.1 K). Dynamical and time-resolved measurements will be enabled by the acquisition of a multi-channel arbitrary waveform generator and high-frequency coaxial cables compatible with ultra-low temperatures. An integrated magnet will allow application of magnetic fields up to 2 tesla.\n\nSSR\n\nQuantum materials increasingly play a leading role in enabling cutting-edge science and quantum technologies. There is tremendous value in shared facilities, interdisciplinary, and commercialization for Danish quantum science. At the Niels Bohr Institute, the new infrastructure will enable crystal growers, quantum device engineers, academics, private companies, and next-generation leaders to carry out research with concrete societal applications in quantum computing and quantum simulations.",

    "title": "Social investments in Europe - What can be learnt from the Nordic countries?",
    "summary": "What\n\nThis book argues that a European growth strategy for including more people and excluding fewer needs policies that invest in people. Using Nordic experiences in a European framework, the book explains how policies called 'social investments' can serve both economic and social goals. These policies are called 'social' because they are mostly found in social, education, labour market, healthcare and housing policies for strengthening and maintaining people's skills and capacities, so they can fully participate in education, employment and social life. \nThese policies are also called 'investments' because they provide an eventual return, even if not in the same area as the original investment. For example a social investment may pay off as a healthy population, with a reduced crime rate.\n\nWhy\n\nA huge question now facing Europe is how we can reform social policies to encourage more inclusive growth and greater economic and social resilience. Social investments might be part of the answer.\nThe project deepens our understanding of social investments theoretically and practically. Theoretically, it sets out how social investment can reach  vulnerable youth, homeless, migrants, and elderly people along with the traditional target groups of children and unemployed. Practically, it examines how problems typically associated with implementation of social investments can be addressed in policy analysis using life course perspectives, socio-economic investment models, integrated case management models, policy delivery packages and public policies informed by behavioral insights.\n\nHow\n\nThe book sets out a novel framework: social investments over the life course that can be applied across many groups and social problems, and that express the essential Nordic welfare idea of investing in people so they can reach their maximum potential which is good for both them and the society around them.\nFor many years I have studied how Denmark deals with various social and economic questions and contributed to the country-comparing reports and EU strategies, including the EU's Social Investment Package. Therefore, I will use ESPN country reports for comparing institutions throughout Europe along with relevant statistics from Eurostat, the World Health Organisation, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to assess what can be learnt from the Nordic countries.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project can help change the way we think of welfare policies in Europe and inform future reforms. By identifying best practice and ways to overcome problems of implementing social investments, social impact is at the centre of the project. Indeed, the book i) sets out and connects all the important ideas in social investments over the life course and demonstrates ii) where they have worked and iii) what are the most promising practices in which policy-makers and researchers may find inspiration.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe European Green Deal presented by the European Commission in December 2019 sets out an ambitious roadmap to transform the European Union into a climate-neutral, circular economy by 2050. The long-term policy framework is characterised by a notable shift from a sectoral to systemic focus, reflecting an awareness of the limitations of established governance approaches and the scale and character of environmental problems facing Europe, including climate change, pollution, and natural resource scarcity. To address these challenges, targeted, measurable, and time-bound missions set a clear direction for research and innovation in the new Horizon Europe programme and reinforce the two main pillars of the European Green Deal around climate action and digitalisation.\n\nWhy\n\nMuch of the debate on missions has so far centred on the entrepreneurial role of the state in creating markets and providing directionality to innovation. There is a need to understand better how missions as coordinating devices can ensure mutually reinforcing dynamics across different levels of governance. The promise of missions is that bottom-up experimentation involving a broader and more diverse set of stakeholders leads to more effective solutions that can be scaled up, thereby contributing to meeting the long-term targets of the European Green Deal. The central interest of this project is the explicit engagement with missions in the environmental domain and the degree to which these can be purposely planned and managed through the coordination of different levels of governance.\n\nHow\n\nThe European Green Deal calls for systemic change to tackle persistent environmental challenges that are deeply rooted in our current modes of production and consumption. This broader and more systemic view of change is grounded in an understanding of system innovation; here understood as transition of socio-technical systems towards more sustainable modes of production and consumption. To this end, there is a need to develop new governance approaches and instruments to manage and coordinate system innovation processes. This project seeks to organise the evidence base on polycentric governance in the context of sustainability transitions to develop an understanding of how mutually reinforcing dynamics at different levels of governance promote socio-technical systems change.\n\nSSR\n\nMissions as a means to address societal and environmental challenges have significant implications in terms of governance structures and processes, the role of government, and knowledge and intelligence needed to inform policymaking. In collaboration with the European Environment Agency, this Carlsberg Foundation Reintegration Fellowship aims to explore practical multi-level governance challenges related to top-down directionality setting of the European Green Deal and bottom-up experimentation promoted through missions in the environmental domain. This is with a view to advance an agenda of a polycentric approach to governance as an appropriate way to formulate and implement challenge-led missions addressing key societal challenges of sustainability.",

    "title": "Understanding Personal Digital Self-Control Struggles and Appropriate Interventions",
    "summary": "What\n\nPeople often struggle to stay in control over their use of smartphones and laptops. Notification-fuelled checking habits distract from more meaningful or urgent tasks, and 'addictive' design patterns like infinitely scrolling newsfeeds nudge people into spending more time on their devices than they intended.\n\nVarious solutions have been suggested, such as limiting or tracking time spent. However, designing appropriate solutions is challenging, because what interventions are helpful often depends on a person's goal and emotional state. \n\nThis project aims to provide a deep understanding of the contextual factors that underlie digital self-control struggles --- of how habits, goals and emotional states meet with the design of digital devices --- and how to select helpful interventions.\n\nWhy\n\nResearchers are testing design solutions to help people stay in control, such as blocking distractions or visualising time spent. People are often ambivalent towards these solutions: sometimes they do not capture actual usage goals (e.g., many wish to change what they do on Facebook,  but not block it altogether). Other times, they are useful only when people are in certain emotional states (e.g., some blocking solutions are mostly useful when people are tired).\n\nAt present, we have no clear understanding of how to accommodate more targeted, within-app goals or the influence of emotional states on self-control needs. This severely limits our ability to provide guidance to user groups such as families, students, and information workers, where digital self-control struggles are widespread.\n\nHow\n\nIn collaboration with the University of Oxford's Counselling Service, we will develop a tool with which users can record their goal, emotional state, and the screen content on their devices, when they experience digital self-control struggles. This tool will also allow users to inspect their data to identify triggers underlying their struggles, and experiment with potential solutions appropriate to their situation. \n\nWe will develop this tool in a co-design process with students who struggle with digital distraction, and evaluate it in a longitudinal study across two Oxford terms. In doing so, the project combines (1) 'ecological momentary assessment' to capture real-time flows of mood, behaviour, and events related to digital self-control struggles, and (2) guided self-experimentation.\n\nSSR\n\nDigital devices such as smartphones and laptops have become essential tools to do our work, get informed or entertained, and stay in touch with friends and family. However, digital self-control struggles can lead to severe negative effects on well-being as well as economic costs, through loss of sleep, impaired social relationships, and declines in productivity. We must therefore find effective solutions to support individuals to stay in control. This project intends to generate key foundational evidence.\n\nAs part of a longer-term road to impact, we plan to integrate our tool into a 'Reducing Digital Distraction' Workshop for students who struggle to manage their digital life. Together with the University of Oxford Counselling service, this workshop will be trialled alongside the project. If successful, I plan to conduct similar workshops at Danish educational institutions.",

    "title": "The Experience of Reading During Covid-19 Lockdowns: Denmark and the UK",
    "summary": "What\n\nThis project is about the reading of novels under the conditions of the COVID-19 lockdown.  We are particularly interested in whether and how the feeling of having more time has or hasn't supported reading.  We are interested in what people read (old novels, dystopian fiction, fantasy), in how they negotiated competition between online news and printed fiction, and in how the literary establishment has dealt with live events and meetings being cancelled.\n\nWe will compare England and Denmark as settings in which reading has been changed by this event, and we'll ask more generally what we can learn from these two case studies about the relation between reading practices, the perception of having or not having time, and the different balance of work and leisure in our lives today.\n\nWhy\n\nIt is certain that in the near future, historians and critics will study Spring 2020 as an exceptional period in the history of human culture.  One thing they will want to know is how we read during lockdown.  This project sets out\n\nto make sure that it is possible for them to answer that question. We are creating an open archive of interviews with readers, reading groups, and institutions that captures this moment in the service of the historians of the future.\n\nWe believe that the ways we read (online, on phones, of fiction) are deeply connected to our modern experience of time.  We are using this exceptional moment of altered time use to investigate more broadly this important question of how our perceptions of time intersect with the ways and the narratives we read.\n\n\nHow\n\nStarting in August, questionnaires will be sent to Danish readers via bloggers, libraries, Litteratursiden.dk, and congregations in order to reach as many readers as possible.  Informants will be selected for oral interviews and conducted by a postdoctoral student with both individual readers and reading groups. All interviews will be recorded. Subsequently, the most interesting stories will be filmed and made available on our website.\n\nA parallel process will be conducted in England with British Academy funding. We will hold a conference in 2021 in Copenhagen to share our initial results and bring stakeholders in the reading process together.  We will publish our findings in academic journals as well on platforms aimed at the wider reader public.\n\nSSR\n\nOne struggle of the 19th and 20th century has been the reduction of working hours -- although in most countries, it's a reality that has not yet come to pass.  We believe that the climate crisis and the COVID-19 situation make it once more conceivable that working less, rather than more, might become larger societal aims.  If this is to become a palatable political position, it's vital that we can say what people would with more leisure time.\n\nReading literature has featured as an alternative to work.  For many people, the fantasy of retirement or a 4 day work week is intimately connected to the idea of finally reading Proust.  With this project we want to test and revive that environmentally sustainable fantasy and to imagine a  future in which working less and reading more are connected.",

    "title": "From plants to animals - understanding inter-kingdom host-shifts of fungal pathogens",
    "summary": "What\n\nThis project aims to understand how fungal colonisations of new host species has influenced the diversity of species interactions. Fungi interact both positively and negatively with plants and animals, and some fungi become highly specialized and completely dependent on their host for survival. However, host-shifts to new host species do occur, but how, when, and why such host shifts occur is not always straightforward to explain.\n\nWhy\n\nIn recent years, we have greatly advanced our understanding of how colonisation of new host species drive pathogen evolution and diversity, due to new insights from host-pathogen molecular mechanisms and population genomic techniques. However, what I call \"wide colonisations\" between hosts of the plant and animal kingdoms are not easily explained by current evolutionary theory. This is despite the fact that such wide colonisations often are key events in organismal evolution, because they lead to subsequent diversification.\n\nThis project aims to understand such wide host-shifts, ultimately with the goal of helping us prevent the emergence of new fungal diseases in plants and animals.\n\nHow\n\nThis project will focus on a specific group of fungi, all from the same genus, that occur in Brazilian citrus plantations. Within these very closely related fungal species there are beneficial plant endophytes, pathogenic fungi that cause plant diseases and insect-pathogenic species. By combining data of the characteristics of \"source\" populations and populations following recent wide colonisation events, it will be possible to study recent natural wide host-shifts.\n\nSSR\n\nPreventing loss to fungal diseases in our food production systems and maintaining biodiversity is of great societal interest. Fungal host shifts is often the initial spark that initiate the emergence of new fungal diseases in agricultural crops. Natural populations of plants and animals may also suffer from fungal diseases that emerged following a host shift. Only by understanding the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms at play during pathogenic host shifts will we be able to predict and prevent unwanted host-shifts in the future.",

    "summary": "What\n\nBimetallic nanoparticles composed of two different metals show unique properties compared to their monometallic counterpart. In this project, I will investigate the 3D structures of bimetallic nanoparticles in real-time under operando conditions by combining state-of-the-art quantitative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-pressure gas cells. I aim to obtain a fundamental understanding of the dynamic evolution and redox mechanisms of bimetallic nanoparticles under realistic reaction conditions, as well as morphological and chemical transformations. I will develop a chemically sensitive 3D characterisation method with a spatial resolution from micrometre down to the atomic level.\n\nWhy\n\nWhen the scale of materials down to 1-100 nanometers, the materials' properties change significantly. The generic understanding of the synergistic effect (size effect + alloying effect) is still unclear hindering the nanotechnology engineering based on such materials. In addition, the behaviour of the nanoparticles under working conditions is completely different from those observed under high vacuum conditions. The dynamic changes of the nanoparticles during reaction or pre-treatment procedures is poorly understood. Therefore, atomistic chemical sensitive 3D investigations under realistic conditions of such systems can add valuable information, both from a fundamental science perspective as well as a technological point of view.\n\nHow\n\nThis project will be carried out at DTU Nanolab and the DNRF VISION centre at DTU physics, which host unique TEM characterization platform, including environmental TEM (ETEM) and a high-pressure gas cells for real-time imaging of atomic morphology evolution under in situ and operando conditions. The experiment for chemically sensitive 3D characterisation will be conducted ex situ in a TEM equipped with an advanced fast EDX detector. Open source software such as MULTEM is used for image simulation, StatSTEM for image quantification, ASTRA toolbox for 3D reconstruction, and OVITO for 3D model visualization. The sample nanoparticles with well-defined size and stoichiometric ratio of two elements will be supplied by SURFCAT at DTU Physics.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project intends to utilize the existing instrumentation at DTU for operando characterisation and chemical sensitive 3D characterisation for alloy nanoparticles. The developed methods open way to investigate functional alloy nanoparticles, such as catalytic nanoparticles, quantum dots, fluorescence nanoparticles, bio-sensing nanoparticles, etc. under their operating conditions. The advances in characterization techniques will benefit both research groups and industrial companies interested in catalysis and functional materials developments.",

    "summary": "Summary\n\nThis project to be carried at Stanford University focuses on Russia and its  role in regionalization of international law, and on the impact that this process exerts on stability of the existing international legal order. With Russia’s increasing geopolitical ambitions, there has been a surge of scholarly interest in how Russia justifies under international law some of its actions condemned by the West.\n\nThe project focuses on the emerging narrative of international law that Russia has been promoting to lend legitimacy to its military actions abroad and foreign policy decisions. It examines Russia’s attempts to refute universality of the Western doctrine of international law by paving the way for its alternative sovereignty-centred concept of international law in close alliance with China.",

    "title": "Vocal communication and group movement dynamics",
    "summary": "What\n\nThis project will investigate the role of vocalisations in facilitating animal group movement 1) directly through collective choices; 2) indirectly through emotional contagion between neighbouring individuals; 3) indirectly by shaping the quality of within-group relationships. By focussing on these three layers of social interactions, my project will provide a complete picture of the impact of sounds on group movement dynamics, from the signal-receiver dyad to the entire network. This will be done using a comparative approach that combines work on highly-vocal and social model species, zebras (Equus quagga), sheep (Ovis aries) and parakeets (Eupsittula sp.).\n\nWhy\n\nThe acoustic channel is a powerful means of communication; it allows a rapid and efficient transmission of many pieces of information simultaneously (e.g. identity, quality, emotions), even across obstacles, long distances and low visibility. However, the field of animal behaviour currently lacks a fundamental understanding of how this means of communication shapes group movement dynamics. This work will move well-beyond traditional approaches in bioacoustics that have mainly focused on the information contained in animal sounds ('encoding'), to document how vocal information affects the behaviour not only of one individual but of entire groups. This will provide a full understanding of group movement dynamics based on all levels of interactions.\n\nHow\n\nThe first part of my project will test the effect of vocalisations on collective choices, using wild plains zebras as a model. To do so, we will use behavioural observations and acoustic recordings, combined with multi-layer network analyses, acoustic analyses, and playback experiments. The second part will test the effect of emotional contagion on sheep collective group movement, using techniques such as infrared thermography and automated tracking systems. Finally, the third part will investigate the impact of vocalisations on parakeet pairwise relationships, and how this affects group movement dynamics as a result. We will use interactive playbacks followed by cognitive bias tests to assess emotions, and social network analyses to test the impact of the playbacks on group dynamics.\n\nSSR\n\nThis work will contribute important insights that can aid the conservation of the near-threatened plains zebra and Eupsittula parakeets, whose populations have been sharply decreasing. Findings on sheep will provide valuable knowledge on how emotions spread in herds, which can help improve animal welfare on farms.",

    "title": "Ethical principles for the use of evidence in democratic decision-making: the special moral responsibilities of democratically elected politicians",
    "summary": "What\n\nMy project aims to unfold the moral responsibilities of democratically elected politicians with respect to their use of evidence. Part I of the project derives a theory about the special moral responsibilities of democratically elected politicians under ideal circumstances from the values that legitimate the moral role of politician in a liberal democracy. Part II maps the challenges politicians as lay people face in handling evidence and discusses how these facts ought to inform a formulation of ethical principles fit for actual, non-ideal circumstances. Part III formulates realistic ethical principles for responsible use of evidence in democratic decision-making under non-ideal circumstances.\n\nWhy\n\nThe project fills a gap in the field of democratic theory which has thus far not been concerned with politicians' moral role and use of evidence. Some democratic theorists have proposed a division of labor according to which politicians define the political aims of the community, while experts and bureaucrats are needed to help devise the means with which to achieve political aims. However, in real-life democracies, politicians sometimes dominate the choice of means in a non-ideal way, for example, by ordering the manipulation of numbers or simply by misunderstanding esoteric evidence. Democratic theorists have not addressed this challenge to the democratic ideal and that is what my project sets out to do.\n\nHow\n\nIn conducting my research, I will be working back and forth between (a) my theory of the moral responsibilities of politicians which I infer from a role-based moral theory in conjunction with theories of the value of liberal democracy in Part I (b) background evidence from social psychology and epistemology on how laypeople may respond to esoteric evidence, expert disagreement and scientific uncertainty which I map in Part II and (c) considered moral judgments about particular cases. I then continuously revise the three levels until I reach a coherent set of ethical principles in Part III.\n\nSSR\n\nThe ethical principles to be developed in this project are meant to be of use to politicians, enabling them to reflect upon and decide how to engage with evidence in particular cases. The principles are not to serve as formal rules, but are to be a resource for reflection. Their purpose is to make politicians responsive to the moral responsibilities that are theirs in virtue of their moral role, their skills or knowledge, and the circumstances of their particular situation. Furthermore, the principles are to be a resource for citizens, media and interest groups enabling them to hold politicians accountable.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe project Alternative Media and Ideological Counterpublics studies the role of hyper-partisan alternative media in the digital public sphere. Hyper-partisan alternative media have become crucial actors in modern societies, and their ideology-driven content presents a critical challenge for journalism, public deliberation and society at large. The project researches the role of left-wing and right-wing alternative online media in the formation of ideological counterpublics vis-à-vis the mainstream public sphere and hence their potential contribution to societal radicalization and the polarization of public discourse.\n\nWhy\n\nThe project will contribute significantly to a rapidly expanding research agenda on the role of alternative media in modern mediated democracy. As the first project to systematically compare right-wing and left-wing alternative media across different countries, it will provide unique insights about how the role of alternative media differs between countries with different traditions of either including or excluding radical voices and viewpoints from the mainstream public sphere.\n\nHow\n\nThe project analyzes how right- and left-wing alternative media in four European countries (Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Austria) form connections to actors from the partisan mainstream, on the one hand, and more radical partisan actors, on the other hand. Four work packages each analyze a particular set of connections: 1) organizational ties and audience overlap, 2) hyperlinking and referencing practices 3) overlap in topics and 4) external content contributors (guest authors, columnists). To this end, the project collects text and video material published on websites, through RSS feeds and on various social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Telegram). This material is supplemented with other relevant documents and expert interviews.\n\nSSR\n\nBroadening and nuancing our understanding of hyper-partisan alternative media and their contribution to the formation of ideological counterpublics, the project results will guide media professionals, regulators and the public at large on how to tackle the challenges of societal radicalization, polarization and misinformation presented by this type of media.",

    "summary": "What\n\nG protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an essential role in cell function and are the targets of about 36% of all the drugs in the market. Their activation by various molecules trigger several signals in cells which play a role in cell fate and tissue function. It has been recently shown that some GPCRs can be activated by mechanical stimuli, in the absence of chemical stimuli.\n\nWhy\n\nBy testing the influence of several kinds of chemical and mechanical stimuli, the study will indicate how a given receptor responds to them depending on the cell and tissue where it is expressed.\nThis information will provide novel insights in cell biology as mechanical stimuli are poorly taken into account in current studies. Furthermore, the technology developed in this project will be suitable to the study of all GPCRs present in the human body.\n\nHow\n\nThe study will combine several types of fluorescence microscopies to study the response of individual cells by quantitative fluorescence imaging. This grant will support the purchase of a portable environmental chamber which can be easily moved to the various microscopes used in our studies in order to maintain cells in optimal culture conditions during measurements over time.\n\nSSR\n\nThe study will provide novel information about GPCR signaling pathways depending on the tissue. \nThe new experimental method will enable the discovery of novel drugs better adapted to each tissue and pathology, which will be more efficient and with less side effects. It will enable novel medical treatments and thereby impact societal healthcare and welfare. Our results will be shared with other scientists via scientific talks and access-free article and via press releases and lay articles to the public.",

    "title": "The neuronal basis of musical imagination",
    "summary": "What\n\nImagine a song that you know by heart. Without effort, you could almost hear it and sing it in your mind. You may even imagine it with twisted lyrics and, if you are musically talented, you could mentally sing it backwards or add new melodic lines to it. This is an example of how rich our musical imagination can be. Yet, we know very little about how the brain represents, holds in memory and manipulates these musical \"thoughts\". To investigate this issue, in collaboration with the Knight laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, I will record neuronal activity directly from inside the brain while human participants perform a simple working memory task involving sequences of musical sounds.\n\nWhy\n\nThe knowledge derived from this project will greatly improve our understanding of auditory perception, memory and the neural processing of music. Furthermore, the patterns of activity recorded directly from inside the brain, which have a high temporal and spatial resolution, could be used to inform research on non-invasive methods such as EEG, potentially leading to significant technological developments.\n\nHow\n\nI will record activity directly from inside the brain of patients with epilepsy who require invasive monitoring of neural activity with electrodes placed inside and on the surface of the brain. This technique is known as intracranial EEG (iEEG). In the experiment, participants are asked to perform a task where they mentally hold and manipulate sequences of musical sounds. To understand the neuronal basis of musical imagination, I will use machine learning techniques to decode imagined sounds from brain activity and will analyze neuronal oscillations at different frequencies and in different brain areas.\n\nSSR\n\nUnderstanding how the brain represents, holds in memory and manipulates sequences of sounds can be the basis for future clinical applications. For example, decoding of auditory imagery from brain activity could help patients with speech impairments to partially recover the ability to communicate. Furthermore, applying the knowledge derived from iEEG research to more accessible non-invasive methods could lead to the improvement of brain-computer interfaces that can be readily used in clinical settings. Consequently, after my project finishes, I wish to further develop this line of research in Denmark, combining iEEG and non-invasive methods, and benefiting from an outstanding international network of collaborators.",

    "summary": "Summary\n\nIn 2001 Poul Møller Pedersen published the book Grønlands Havalger, his life's work. It is the first book ever to describe in detail the seaweeds of Greenland, morphology and ecology, and it was illustrated with numerous colour figures, showing the seaweeds in situ and as microphotos of very high quality. Around 200 species are treated.\n\nThis will for years to come be the reference work to consult for information of seaweeds from Greenland, nationally or internationally, no person but the author had/has such a deep knowledge of Greenland seaweeds. Sadly, the author died a few years later. Together with another former friend of Poul Møller Pedersen's, we decided, therefore, to translate the the book into English, thereby making this milestone available internationally.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThis project is about topological quantum field theory (TQFT), which is an interdisciplinary field between mathematics and physics. \n\nMore concretely, it is about the mathematical theories of the Reshetikhin-Turaev Topological Quantum Field Theory, Quantum-Chern-Simons theory, Symplectic and Algebraic Geometry and the new theories from physics  called resurgence and brane-quantization.\n\nThe aim of the project is to further the development of the theories of brane-quantization and resurgence, to synthesize them, and to use them in Topological Quantum Field Theory to prove new mathematical results.\n\nWhy\n\nFrom a broad viewpoint the project addresses two foundational problems in physics. \n\n1) The first is the use of Feynman-path-integrals in physics. This have been a great success, giving some of the most accurately verified predictions in all of science. However; there is no sound mathematical foundation for their use. The heuristics is understood though, and this is via so-called perturbation theory. Resurgence is a theory which applies to perturbation theory. \n\n2) The second is the problem of quantization and concerns the passage from classical mechanicals to quantum theory. Brane-quantization is a new proposal for this.\n\nMany important mathematical results in geometry are expected to follow this project. Historically, mathematics have greatly benefitted from new ideas from physics.\n\nHow\n\nMy prior research is about the so-called Reshetikhin-Turaev Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), which is a theory in which the quantization process as well as the Feynman-path-integrals are mathematically well-understood. The latter are known as Quantum Invariants. \n\nPart of my work have been to mathematically prove conjectures about these quantum invariants, which are motivated from the resurgence theory. Continuing this line of research will further our understanding of resurgence. \n\nSimultaneously, I will work on developing the mathematical framework for brane-quantization and employing it to TQFT. \nCentral to the quantization process  in TQFT is the study of moduli spaces over surfaces, which allow for the use of powerful techniques from algebraic and symplectic geometry.\n\nSSR\n\nResearch in TQFT is potentially of immense importance to society. TQFT have already found applications in quantum computing, and possibly in the future resurgence will contribute to this, as resurgence gives computational recursive schemes.\n\nThe long term societal benefits from a precise mathematical geometric understanding of quantum field theory and quantization is potentially of even bigger significance - and hopefully this project will contribute hereto.",

    "title": "Harnessing the beneficial potential of neuroinflammation",
    "summary": "What\n\nMultiple sclerosis is a disabling disease where brain and spinal cord are attacked by the immune system leading to destruction of the axons and myelin sheaths. This damage is insufficiently repaired by the body due to ongoing inflammation. The immune cells of the brain and spinal cord (microglia) play a major part in this inflammation. Recently, activated microglia were linked to repair and protection.\nThis project aims to explore the reparative potential of activated microglia. I will first examine the mechanism behind the repair and protection offered by these cells. I will then identify drugs that will promote this activation in patients.\n\nWhy\n\nRecently, microglia have attracted much attention within the scientific community for their great potential for protection and repair. Dr. Yong's research group has recently identified an experimental way to activate microglia. These microglia showed increased reparative functions compared to conventionally activated microglia. To identify drugs that will induce this strongly reparative microglia subset in patients, we need to increase our knowledge of the mechanism behind the beneficial functions.\nIdentification of drugs that generates the reparative microglia subset is a step forward in the fight against multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, the drug will have potential benefits for all patients with brain or spinal cord damage such as stroke or spinal cord injury.\n\nHow\n\nI will use a combination of cell culture experiments and different animal models for multiple sclerosis. These methods will help me to characterize the strongly beneficial microglia and elucidate the mechanism behind the reparative function.\nI will then test a library of pre-approved therapies in human cell culture experiments to identify candidates that could induce these reparative microglia in patients. These candidates will then be tested using the animal models mentioned above to confirm their beneficial effect in a living organism.\n\nSSR\n\nDenmark and Canada are among the countries with the highest prevalence of multiple sclerosis. Right now, the approved therapies for multiple sclerosis do not prevent accumulation of damage, it is therefore of utmost importance to identify therapies that can help prevent this. Identifying ways to harness the process of self-repair in the brain and spinal cord will ultimately help many patients with brain or spinal cord damage and not just multiple sclerosis patients. This project will help lift the socioeconomic burden associated with disability.\nUsing a pre-approved therapy will strongly reduce the time it normally takes from identification of a potential drug candidate to use in the clinic. Therefore, it will reduce the time before this project will be beneficial for patients.",

    "title": "Connectivity and Disruption: Development, Neighboring, and Livelihoods in China's Belt and Road Borderlands",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project will examine local experiences of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a development mode in China's borderlands with Myanmar. While BRI infrastructure connects people by revitalizing cross-border trade routes, it also disrupts old livelihoods and creates new social distances. Construction of new infrastructure make some ethnic minority villagers sell their land and abandon farming. While some villagers seize upon BRI connectivities by engaging in cross-border trade, others articulate current development as cultural disruption, and seek to maintain ethnic distinctiveness through distance. The project will study such dynamics of connectivity and disruption through ethnographic fieldwork in a mountain village in the China-Myanmar borderlands populated by ethnic Jingpo.\n\nWhy\n\nThe BRI drives a China-centered development mode that may reshuffle global, regional, and local orders. Many state leaders welcome Chinese infrastructure investments, but accusations of debt-trap diplomacy, landgrabs, and dispossession of marginalized groups taint China's projection of the BRI as offering universal benefits. While the landlocked, mountainous topography of China-Myanmar borderlands have allowed local ethnic groups to develop unique social and cultural forms, the BRI is transforming these national peripheries into centers for development and change. The project addresses a gap of knowledge about how ethnic minorities in China's borderworlds act upon BRI infrastructural development by theorizing local forms of adaptation and resilience to rapid changes among ethnic Jingpo.\n\nHow\n\nThe study will be based on ethnographic fieldwork in Banyang village, which is home to 500 ethnic Jingpo. Many Jingpo villagers are selling their land use rights to development companies that construct highways, a railway line, and factories under the auspices of the BRI. Participation in, and observation of village activities, including farming, trade, and social and ritual activities, will be combined with recording of oral histories to document sociocultural changes over a longer time-span, including changing roles of local dongsha shamans. A household survey will map household economies and land use rights, and an ethnographic film will be produced to compare economic lives of villagers who remain farmers versus villagers who sell their land rights for BRI development.\n\nSSR\n\nOn-the-ground research is crucial for crafting commercial, political, and ethical responses to the unfolding of China's Belt and Road Initiative. The project will offer timely local perspectives on a Chinese development mode that is currently expanding through the BRI. It will further give voice to villagers from an ethnic group in China that is under-researched in the social sciences.",

    "title": "Support exchange: The effect on entrepreneurial performance in an uncontrollable online world",
    "summary": "What\n\nAs entrepreneurs are increasingly more present on online social media platforms, they are also exposed to more uncontrollable and instant dimensions of social support from a diverse group of people. They may therefore suddenly find themselves in unexpected situations online with significant influences on their experienced stress level which in turn impacts their cognition, mental well-being and performance. It is therefore important to understand how social support unfolds, functions and impacts entrepreneurs on online social media platforms depending on differences in their online social skills. This understanding leads to practical implications on how to be active online, which online skills are required, and how to operate and perform in a more uncontrollable support environment.\n\nWhy\n\nSocial support to entrepreneurs in offline exchanges significantly influences entrepreneurial behavior, mental well-being and performance, but these influences are expected to be different and potentially intensified in online exchanges. When interactions move online, social norms of behavior and built-in expectations related to social support are different and change how interactions between people take place - they often become more volatile and fluctuating. The project is expected to advance current theoretical understandings of entrepreneurs' network by proposing a new research agenda, where online exchanges are seen as significantly different than offline exchanges of social support, and where increased attention is given to the new types of skills required in online interactions.\n\nHow\n\nThe project consists of three complementary studies. The first study involves data scraping from online social media platforms to see how social support is expressed and exchanged online. The second study utilizes the experience sampling methodology to capture the dynamic nature of social support in real time, and finally a longitudinal three-wave study will capture the influence of various dimensions of social support on entrepreneurial performance. The project uniquely enables theorizing of how social media influences entrepreneurs on a personal level as well as their performance. The studies will be carried out in close collaboration with a network of national and international experts in the cross-fields of entrepreneurship, networks, social support, social media and mental well-being.\n\nSSR\n\nFocusing on efforts to improve entrepreneurs' mental well-being is of vital importance for the development and sustainability of entrepreneurs in society long-term. This project offers unique insights into the antecedents of entrepreneurs' mental well-being and its influence on performance of entrepreneurs exposed to various types of social support, positive and negative, online. More importantly, the project focuses on how entrepreneurs can cope mentally and perform economically when facing new challenges from online support exchanges. This understanding is important for firm survival rates, growth and development of society.",

It contributes to international debates and urgent rethinking on sustainability and global commons. The book demonstrates and develops a view of morality from the ground up, and from challenges of sharing. The project puts the indigenous Ik back on the world map with a new global reputation and relevance.\n\nWhy\n\nSharing Mountains will be the first monograph published about the Ik since Colin Turnbull's world- famous, notorious book The Mountain People, which pitched the Ik as amoral and created intense debate, but left the Ik largely ignored. Fifty years later, Sharing Mountains, will shift the perspective and not only propose a different view of the Ik, but also address urgent matters of sharing commons and land in an era, where people on the fringe of global interest are increasingly forgotten.\n\nHow\n\nI will follow up on research and write Sharing Mountains with focused attention. Starting September 2021, I will spend 12 months writing up the material I have already gathered during fieldwork, doing a small archival study of Turnbull's Ik material, and updating on relevant discussions. I plan one field trip to Ik County to fact-check and confirm consent from interlocutors for quotes and photographs in accordance with GDPR. I plan to visit the Avery Archives in USA and present findings at the AAA conference in 2021. I will submit the manuscript to Chicago University Press as part of their Anthropology and African Studies Series.\n\nSSR\n\nThe book will counter stigmatising representation of the indigenous Ik and contribute to debates about sustainability and global commons from local perspectives. Reflections on moralities of sharing resources are urgent for societies and humanity.",

    "title": "Ikke-termaliserende kvantesystemer og opdukkende symmetri",
    "summary": "What\n\nObjects at different temperatures tend to reach the same temperature if we bring them in contact with one another. This is dictated by the laws of thermodynamics, which are at work all over the place in everyday life. It has turned out, however, that there are physical systems that behave differently. Some do not thermalize at all, while others may or may not thermalize depending on the conditions. The aim of the project is to find new types of nonthermal behaviors in strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. We will also investigate how emergent symmetry can influence the thermalization properties.\n\nWhy\n\nThe laws of thermodynamics have huge consequences for how physical systems behave, and finding something that does not thermalize opens up new opportunities, for instance with respect to information storage. At the moment, we know relatively little about exceptions to thermal behavior in quantum systems. One important class of nonthermal systems has been identified and investigated thoroughly, but recently it has become clear that there are many other examples. Research in this area is important, because it is likely that there are entirely new types of behaviors to be discovered. It is also important, because we would like to have a complete understanding of how quantum systems can behave and when they behave in a particular way.\n\nHow\n\nWe will construct new types of models of quantum mechanical systems and investigate their properties numerically. The standard way to construct quantum mechanical models is to start from a description of how the particles interact and then translate that into a model. We will obtain models with unusual properties by turning the construction upside down. We start from special states giving rise to the unusual properties, and then we determine how the particles should interact to have these states present in the model. Once the model is constructed, we study it further with large scale computer simulations. When we find interesting new behaviors, we also investigate how simple we can make the models, while still maintaining the interesting properties.\n\nSSR\n\nNew technology increasingly relies on quantum mechanical effects, and in order to identify all the possibilities, it is important to understand how quantum mechanical systems can behave. Each new type of behavior provides a new type of building block that can be utilized to do new things. The project contributes to building up such an understanding in an area, where we do not yet have a good overview. With more advanced technology, we are better equipped to tackle societal challenges.",

    "title": "The British Imperial System and the End of German Colonialism, 1880-1926",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project concerns the confiscation of Germany's colonies after the First World War and its long-term ramifications. Although this is often considered a nominal historical event, it had far-reaching consequences: For the British Empire, former German colonies now possessed by Australia and South Africa revealed an ongoing decentralization that would ultimately result in the creation of the Commonwealth. In international  politics, by justifying the takeover on humanitarian grounds (and on German mistreatment of Africans), it set a precedent that made colonial rule far more burdensome than before and, in turn, inscribed certain elements of imperialism into history's first attempt at a global governance.\n\nWhy\n\nThe outbreak and consequences of the First World War remains some of the most fundamental issues in history. The war fundamentally changed the world and initiated the gradual decline of European colonialism. The project will provide fresh interpretations on the outbreak of the war, by placing especially Anglo-German relations in a new historical context. It also sheds light on the implicit consequences of an otherwise neglected issue and thereby gives us a better understanding of global governance in its formative stage. Fundamentally, the project bridges several historical approached and will map the intrinsic relations between foreign policy interests and humanitarian concerns: an aspect that is still incredibly important for how states and international organizations act today\n\nHow\n\nThe project has already been supported by the Carlsberg Foundation before, which has enabled me to collect all the empirical evidence needed. All the remains is the daunting task of writing. The project is hosted at the University of Oxford and at the Oxford Centre for Global History, arguably the most prestigious of its kind. Being at the University of Oxford is ideal for this project: it's state-of-the-art facilities such as the Bodleian Library and its scholarly environment will be particularly beneficial. Supported by expert scholars like Professor of Imperial History, Andrew Thompson, the project have a formidable academic backing. During the project, hypotheses and findings will be tested at conferences and a formal book proposal will be prepared for a world-leading publisher.\n\nSSR\n\nColonialism and its legacies have been increasingly popular in public debates and have become subject to radical views on both the far right and the far left. But the colonial world and the imperial world order was far more complex and nuanced that the views espoused in such debates. It therefore remains crucial for historians to insist on the historical nuances that defined our past. This project will, in part, reveal that while  humanitarian interventionism did have a more pragmatic reasoning, it also emanated from an actual concern and desire to change the world for the better. \n\nAnother important aspect, is that the project will show how states react when atrocities or scandals occur. The British in 1904-8 censored and overlooked the German genocide of the Herero and Nama in present-day Namibia in order to prevent Germany being provoked. Similar patterns are evident when major powers like China in today's world are virtually exempt from international scrutiny. The project can help us understand why certain atrocities, scandals or events are reacted upon and why others are not.",

    "title": "Low-Temperature CO2 Valorization",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe goal of my project is to develop a catalytic system that effectively transforms CO2 to industrially useful chemical building blocks under very mild conditions. The catalytic system employs a two-step process consisting of a CO2 capturing part and a utilization part. Hence, a rational design of both the CO2 capture component and the transformation catalyst is essential to reach high activity at low temperature and pressure. I will demonstrate cheap and benign production of the C1 building blocks, formic acid and methanol. Both products are large-scale industrial commodities used in a plethora of industry processes. In addition, they are promising candidates as energy carriers for a future sustainable energy grid.\n\nWhy\n\nThis project will contribute to the development of a future sustainable society. I will do so by developing an unprecedented effective catalytic system for transforming CO2. In more detail, I will reveal that careful tailoring of the CO2 capture part to the transformation part has a powerful effect on catalytic CO2 valorization. In fact, I will prove that it becomes feasible to valorize CO2 under extraordinarily mild conditions by following my approach. Thus, my findings will not only become key to understanding the importance of cooperative catalysis for small molecule transformations, they will also contribute to paving the way for benign and effective CO2 valorization processes.\n\nHow\n\nWe will employ homogeneous organotransition metal catalysis in highly polar solvents for the thermochemical transformation of captured CO2. We will use applied pressures of gaseous mixtures of CO2 and H2 at various temperatures to facilitate the CO2 conversion to either formic acid or methanol. For the optimization process, especially the combination of catalyst and solvent will be of focus, for which qualitative and quantitative analyses of both liquid- and gas phases will ensure a rational approach. The team will consist of two postdocs and a PhD student.\n\nSSR\n\nExcessive levels of CO2 emission is the main culprit for the anthropogenic climate changes that we are witnessing. The world is facing an environmental as well as societal need for shifting from an economy driven by previous technologies based on fossil fuels and petrochemicals to a modern circular economy based on sustainable and financially viable solutions. In such a scenario, a low-temperature and benign method for efficiently utilizing CO2 as a universal C1 building block constitutes an absolute cornerstone. I will develop a viable CO2 sequestering tool, which will incur CO2 conservation from waste streams, lowering the anthropogenic CO2 level in the atmosphere.",

    "title": "Prospective strategies for improving self-control",
    "summary": "What\n\nMy project will investigate the effectiveness of prospective self-control strategies and their potential for improving people's self-control. Prospective self-control strategies seek to prevent the emergence or limit the strength of temptations, thereby reducing the need for the effortful self-control, which generally has a rather modest success rate. In doing so, I will specifically focus on two prospective self-control strategies: situation selection and goal support. Situation selection involves strategically identifying and avoiding tempting situations (e.g., a smoker avoiding bars that allow smoking), whereas goal support involves pursuing goals in the company of other people who actively support these goals (e.g., an aspiring runner running together with a running 'buddy').\n\nWhy\n\nExtensive research has identified self-control as an important predictor of leading a healthy, financially stable, and happy life. Self-control is also a significant predictor of the success of people's behavior change efforts. Yet, the precise mechanisms through which self-control leads to successful behavior change and life outcomes are still not well understood. This also means that our current knowledge of how to improve people's self-control is limited. Recent research has identified numerous self-control strategies used by people who are generally good at self-control. However, research on the effectiveness of individual self-control strategies is still in its infancy and further evidence is needed to properly evaluate their merits.\n\nHow\n\nMy project involves a two-part research program. First, I will investigate people's meta-knowledge of the scope of self-control strategies, what self-control strategies they commonly use, and whether they deliberately select between them based on their perceived effectiveness. This will be done through an online survey with a nationally representative sample. Second, I will investigate the effectiveness of two prospective self-control strategies (situation selection and goal support) in ensuring progress on important personal goals. I plan to examine this through an online randomized controlled trial with an experience-sampling design, which permits obtaining causal and longitudinal estimates of the strategies' effectiveness with limited intrusion from memory biases.\n\nSSR\n\nSelf-control is a critical component of behavior change, which is currently center-stage in societal efforts to mitigate climate change, reverse global biodiversity loss, combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and improve public health more broadly. Self-control is also positively linked to physical and mental health (e.g., lower stress and anxiety), subjective wellbeing, personal financial stability, educational achievement, and relationship quality. Thus, identifying effectiveness interventions for improving people's self-control may have considerable personal and societal benefits.",

    "title": "Plastics and the Anthropocene: The Bads Associated with the Goods We Consume",
    "summary": "What\n\nPlastic pollution is a pressing global concern, and there is an urgent need for research into the sociocultural dimensions of plastic use and disposal. Examining how risks related to plastics are experienced, thought about, and responded to in different contexts is crucial to our theoretical and practical understanding of the interactions between bodies, environments, and toxicity in the Anthropocene. This research project aims to address that need by exploring what people in urban and rural India, Indonesia, and the Philippines find to be the benefits and risks of using plastic food containers and bottles and what they find to be the advantages, risks, and constraints of different methods of disposing of the resulting plastic wastes, with particular focus on the open burning of wastes.\n\nWhy\n\nThis project is located at the cutting-edge of anthropological research on the far-ranging impact of plastics on health-environment systems. It will bring science and technology studies (STS) on plastics in dialogue with an emerging body of medical anthropological work on how toxic chemicals make complicated demands on human bodies. Most studies of toxicity and human-environmental health have been situated in the Global North, and the study of plastics as a material related to yet distinct from these chemicals is largely missing. This project will augment that literature with a focus on people's concerns about the toxicity of plastics in the Global South, and it will promote an anthropology of plastics that lies at the intersection of environmental and medical anthropology and STS.\n\nHow\n\nThe project will involve partnering with universities in the Netherlands, the USA, Indonesia, and the Philippines to build Global North-South bridges and to launch the first global research network on an anthropology of plastics. Ethnographic fieldwork consisting of participant-observation, observation, and interviews will be conducted in Indonesia and the Philippines (which feature high on the list of countries contributing to marine plastics) and in India (which has committed to becoming single-use plastic free by 2022). The project will build on my earlier work, which has made the case for an anthropology of plastics as having urgent ecological and health relevance, and will also engage junior researchers to further develop this research field.\n\nSSR\n\nThe environmental and health costs of plastic pollution are an acute global concern, and research that examines how individuals, stakeholders, and communities engage with and understand plastics can inform interventions to tackle the harms of plastics and plastic pollution. The open burning of plastic wastes in the Global South is a widespread but ignored method of disposal that releases toxic persistent organic pollutants (such as dioxins and furans), contributes to air pollution, and has long-term health risks. The results of this project will help us better understand why these risks are invisible or tolerated, and they will assist in developing safer, more locally appropriate methods of disposal. On a broader level, the project's results will aid policymakers, health and development programs, industry associations, and community-based groups in developing context-sensitive interventions to mitigate the harms of plastic pollution and in re-designing consumer plastics to be more sustainable, not just in South and Southeast Asia but also globally. They will also help inform action aimed at the UN Sustainable Development Goals related to conserving marine and land-based ecosystems and minimizing the health and environmental harms of post-consumer wastes. Overall, as the world increasingly reckons with the biosocial disruptions of anthropogenic ecological degradation, this project aims to contribute to global efforts to protect vulnerable populations and achieve healthier, more sustainable engagements with the environment.",

    "summary": "What\n\nDiscussions about how museums can respectfully represent all parts of society and critically engage with their own colonial past have made way for new strategies of inclusion and have given previously untold stories new levels of attention. In this research project I examine the links between museums and activism and explore how recent calls for decolonisation impact museum practices in the leading ethnographic museums of the two most dominant former colonial powers in Europe, the United Kingdom and France. My main focus is the changing curatorial practices at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and le Musée du Quai Branly in Paris, where debates about decolonisation and repatriation have been central in recent years.\n\nWhy\n\nFor many years museums neglected their responsibility to not only cater for but also represent a more diverse part of society. Only within recent years have curators and other museum professionals begun to discuss more openly the negative impacts of previous curatorial practices and publicly engage in debates about decolonisation and repatriation. In light of the negative impact that stereotypical and racist representations of museum collections have had on society, it is urgent to study how museums attempt to decolonise and remove themselves from previous curatorial practices. With a postcolonial approach, this project focuses on how two leading institutions within the field attempt to diversify their representation and shed new light on previously neglected parts of their history.\n\nHow\n\nBuilding on and expanding the research methods applied in my PhD thesis on curatorial challenges and processes of decolonisation in museums in South Africa, I will base the findings of my research on anthropological fieldwork including participatory observations of curatorial practices and visitor behaviour. My approach will also include thorough examinations of the wording of exhibition labels, the layout and content of the exhibitions as well as interviews with museum visitors, stakeholders in the public debate, curators and other museum professionals about their views on how museums attempt to decolonise and include more voices. These interviews and observations will lead to an insight into the curatorial challenges involved in meeting expectations from museum visitors and non-visitors.\n\nSSR\n\nThis research project is cutting-edge in its focus on both senders and recipients of contemporary curatorial practices, at a time when colonial discourses are renegotiated, and demands for greater recognition of the importance of race, play an increasingly central role. The project builds upon recent interdisciplinary research dealing with postcolonial museum practices and links it with current public debates about repatriation and decolonisation. It focuses on how leading ethnographic museums, in two of Europe's most dominant former colonial powers, the United Kingdom and France, attempt to diversify their representation and shed new light on previously neglected parts of the history of their collections. Through this, the research project will build up field-based theory contributing to the knowledge on how museums reshape their curatorial practices and potentially change public understandings of the colonial past and its present legacies.",

Doubting our ability to be unbiased when reading of the past, we study the very communication of the past into later historical periods.\n\nTaking as our point of departure the astounding longevity and ubiquity in our culture of so many themes, genres, visual forms, personalities, etc. from the ancient world, the conference will focus on popular receptions of Classical Antiquity. In doing so, we will explore reception phenomena in which subjects and themes are selected that make immediate sense in a ‘present’, and the appreciation of them does not require any scholarly insights.",

    "title": "Populism and Democratic Defence in Europe",
    "summary": "What\n\nPopulist parties can function as a ‘correction’ to liberal democracy by highlighting popular grievances and lack of elite responsiveness, but they often put liberal democracy under pressure due to a problematic relationship with key liberal democratic principles and institutions. The aim of the project is thus to investigate how liberal democracies can respond to populist pressures in an effective and legitimate manner. We evaluate effectiveness of legal, cultural and political responses to populist parties in seven European countries – Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Italy, Hungary and Poland – and apply normative political theories to the specific challenges of populism.\n\nWhy\n\nThe agendas and policies of populists, who have gained more support and power in recent years, put liberal democracy under pressure both at the national and at the European level. Attacks on liberal democratic institutions at the national level are not just of national concern since they impact the rights of all European citizens and not least the democratic preconditions of European politics overall. At the level of supranational European politics, the growing self-confidence of populists, such as the alliance of right wing populists in Europe of Nations and Freedom may signal a new era. Populist parties thus constitute a European challenge for those concerned with the protection of liberal democracy and call for democratic defence measures at both levels.\n\nHow\n\nThe research will be carried out by a 12-person consortium of researchers working under the joint coordination of 5 Principal Investigators situated at the universities in Wroclaw, Warsaw, Lund, Roskilde and Aarhus. In practice, the research questions are examined through three integrated thematic modules. Module I addresses the laws, political alliances, policies, etc. undertaken by domestic actors in response to populism. Module II shares the goals of Module I – mapping and evaluating the effectiveness of responses – but focuses on the trans- and supranational level. Module III evaluates the normative legitimacy of national, trans- and supranational responses to populism.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project contributes to long term aspects of Social Scientific Responsibility by exploring the variety of ways in which different democratic communities in Europe as well as the European community itself respond to populists and by discussing what legitimate responses are. It will give citizens and policy makers more theoretically and empirically-grounded knowledge to understand which responses to populists work without producing perverse effects and without undermining valued qualities of liberal democracy. In short, the project will contribute to more enlightened choices in the defence of liberal democracy.",

    "summary": "What\n\nMyosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) is a protein that is abundant in the heart and skeletal muscles. Despite this knowledge, we still don't really know how this particular protein works and how it influences muscle contraction and relaxation. The present project aims to clarify this by specifically studying its function, its interactions with neighbouring proteins (such as myosin) and its requirements in terms of energy costs. Additionally, the current work will assess how MyBP-C has adapted and evolved among species and whether this has implications on muscle contraction, relaxation and metabolism.\n\nWhy\n\nOur studies will provide important basic muscle biology insights. They will also give valuable information for the development of targeted therapies for cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases associated with mutations in MyBP-C.\n\nHow\n\nThis project will consist of a multidisciplinary approach combining (1) computational biology to model intra- and inter-molecular changes and metabolic differences; (2) biochemistry to produce protein constructs; and (3) cell physiology/biophysics to study MyBP-C function and metabolism in muscle cells.\n\nSSR\n\nWe have identified four main pathways to social impact: (1) Impact by training: the current project will allow two appointed individuals (postdoctoral researcher and PhD student) to develop a range of unique and specialist skills such as learning new techniques and gaining communication skills by presenting their work to the scientific communities and to a more general audience; (2) Impact on scientific community: the present research project combining state-of-the-art methods and unique techniques has the potential to move the field into completely uncharted scientific territory. I predict that the findings of the present proposal, will be of great interest for scientists working in disciplines such as physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, cell/evolution biology and structural/molecular biology; (3) Impact on drug target discovery: The economic and medical consequences of mutations in MyBP-C are large (lethal cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases); and (4) Impact on society via engagement of the public in science: I am a member of various scientific societies and take active roles in trying to engage interested members of the public, particularly younger people, in science.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe funding will be used to acquire an advanced microscope that allows researchers to image the structure and composition of materials with extremely high resolution. The vision is to build a versatile facility for transmission electron microscopy with users from physics, nanoscience and chemistry who study a variety of different materials, ranging from catalyst particles to computer chips. The grant from the Carlsberg Foundation complements government funding for Forskningsinfrastruktur.\n\nWhy\n\nElectron microscopy is an essential tool for investigating man-made and natural materials at the highest level of detail. It allows looking at materials down the the atomic level, so with this new instrument, we will be able to see how atoms sit together in complex materials and determine the size and shape of nanoparticles. At the University of Copenhagen a number of research groups are developing new materials with features at the nanoscale. The synthesis of these materials can only be improved if we can get detailed insight into their structure, i.e. we must be able to take pictures with the highest possible resolution. Transmission electron microscopy is best tool for this.\n\nHow\n\nThe microscope will be accessible to researchers working on a range of different projects. We have two main activities, addressing quantum materials and nanostructured catalysts, respectively. For the first one, we synthesize materials with properties not found in nature, of interest for fundamental research as well as future quantum technologies. The second vision is to develop materials for renewable energy conversion and synthesis of green fuels and chemicals. For this we will develop new catalysts by mapping the relation between material synthesis, structure and properties. The research is conducted at the Center for Quantum Devices, Center for High Entropy Alloy Catalysis and the Nanoscience Center, University of Copenhagen, and the instrument is hosted by the Niels Bohr Institute.\n\nSSR\n\nNew materials play a key role in solving grand challenges; from solar cells to catalysts for sustainable production of fuels and fertilizers, and as a backbone for quantum computers, to name a few examples. Our new instrument will boost ongoing materials science in some of these areas, and contribute to building a versatile Forskningsinfrastruktur that will benefit also the coming generation who may invent materials that have not been foreseen by today's researchers. We envisage interdisciplinary projects to thrive in this environment. Finally, seeing - by electron microscopy - the intricate structures of complex materials is a great way to develop intuition and understanding, and as such the tool will strengthen university education and advanced research training in this important area.",

    "title": "Polis Histories and Local Identities: Historiographical and Philosophical Innovations in the Age of Glocalization, c. 400-200 BCE",
    "summary": "What\n\nThis project investigates and re-evaluates ancient Greek local history, aiming to explain how the concept of localism was applied to historiography and to what extent this type of writing was grounded in the wider intellectual framework of Classical and Hellenistic thought. By placing this practice in the context of the historiographical and philosophical innovations of the fourth and third century BCE, the project will show how local history emerged organically from its historical and intellectual context. The project is based on the hypothesis that local historians constructed a local identity within the framework of the city state constantly blending objectives of preservation and (re)invention of the past.\n\nWhy\n\nWhile research into the city state as an institution has been carried out (e.g. The Copenhagen Polis Centre), scant attention has been paid to those narratives examining the history of individual city states. The project addresses this lack by offering an innovative research program that carries out a comprehensive and much-needed reinterpretation of the most important historiographical genre of the Hellenistic age. The project makes two important contributions that will profoundly change how the genre is perceived: 1) it applies a modern theoretical approach to interpret the ancient fragmentary material and 2) it advances the field of Greek historiography by connecting localism to the innovations of Aristotle, antiquarians, and chronographers.\n\nHow\n\nBy drawing on the interdisciplinary theoretical concept of Intentionale Geschichte - i.e. the idea that every generation form a concept of their own history that supports their understanding of their own identity in the present - the aim is to examine how collective identity was constructed through the interpretation of decisive historical periods, events and individuals. The project is part of a new wave of memory studies focusing on how historical texts constructed a local community, how a group related its inner coherence to other entities, and what a society thought was important to pass on to the next generation. This approach will significantly improve our understanding of the numerous ways historians reassessed the past to construct an identity centered around the city state.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project contributes strongly to an interdisciplinary research agenda with a theoretical basis in Memory Studies. The aim is to study collective identities across geographical and chronological borders, since understanding an era so fundamentally characterized and shaped by globalization is impossible without a transnational perspective. This further connects the project to the modern themes of globalism, nationalism and glocalization - i.e. the presence of particularizing and universalizing tendencies occurring at the same time - in the way it investigates how local identity is constructed within a global framework and how local history becomes global in the framework of the modern metropolis, i.e. the city state. By incorporating such diverse concepts into the study of ancient Greek historiography, this project will create a model for future studies of memory and identity in past societies.",

Our basic contention is that an updated philosophical anthropology must be perspectivist in the sense that it must unite an open series of approaches describing different aspects of human beings\n\nHow\n\nHumanity Contested provides a new view of the anthropological underpinnings of democracy.

    "title": "Which Zoonosis Will Plague Us Next: Exploring Pathogenic Bacteria and Vira in Danish Wildlife through Large-Scale Analyses of Danish Hedgehogs",
    "summary": "What\n\nOutbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19, SARS and Ebola transferred from animals to humans (zoonoses) have increased in the past decades. Previous research\nindicate that this phenomenon is the direct result of increased contact between humans, wildlife and livestock, as people move into undeveloped areas and destroy the natural habitats of different wildlife species. Therefore, one of the few methods for safeguarding ourselves against the next pandemic caused by zoonosis is by investigating and monitoring bacteria and vira already present in species of wildlife, which we are likely to come into contact with. This project intends to improve our understanding of future potential zoonotic illnesses in wildlife through a large-scale study of the model species Erinaceus europaeus, the hedgehog.\n\nWhy\n\nNew pandemics will arise as a direct result of human interference with biodiversity. The results from this project will improve our understanding and monitoring of potential zoonotic transfers between wildlife and humans. The knowledge gained will aid in the overall safeguarding against future epidemics, which will benefit society in general.\n\nHow\n\nI intend to investigate the health of the Danish hedgehog population to improve the conservation of the species and identify specific pathogens with the potential for zoonotic transfers to humans and pets. I will analyse stomach contents, faecal samples and nasal swabs from 697 dead hedgehogs to assess their microbiome (including pathogenic bacteria), food choice and prevalence of Corona virus strains. \nThe samples for this research were obtained during my PhD project \"The Danish Hedgehog Project\" in 2016, where over 400 volunteers collected the dead hedgehogs from all over Denmark. \nThe investigations will be carried out within the framework of interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers at WildCRU University of Oxford, Aalborg University, University of Copenhagen and SSI.\n\nSSR\n\nMy research has a high societal relevance as I work with zoonotic transfers of disease between wildlife and humans, such as COVID-19. \nAt the same time, the overall goal of my research is to improve the conservation and protection of the European hedgehog in the wild. Hopefully my research will inspire citizens to help protect this adorable and popular species, enabling future generations to enjoy the unique nature experience of encountering the fascinating hedgehog in their gardens.  \nI furthermore make an effort of communicating my research to the public with the purpose of bridging the gap between science and society.",

    "summary": "What\n\nBetween 1872 and 1894, Danish-born labor leader Louis Pio was in the midst of the world's most important class-based conflicts (e.g. the 1886 Haymarket Affair which led to the 1st of May International Workers' Day) and organized a Scandinavian Knights of Labor chapter in Chicago to bridge traditional class, race, and gender divides. \nYet, by the 1890s the Knights of Labor had all but vanished and labor leaders such as Pio were increasingly engaged in exclusionary racial practices in America.\n\"Transplanting Socialism\" examines this shift based on a hypothesis that Danish socialists like Pio arrived in the United States convinced that international solidarity held the key to remaking the world, but found themselves shackled to - and ultimately remade by - American ideas of white supremacy.\n\nWhy\n\n\"Little is known of Louis Pio's attempt to transplant socialist ideas to America, despite\r\narchivist Børge Schmidt's 1950 call for such a study to shed light on \"\"the Danish labor movement's earlier history.\"\" Nor has Pio's potential been recognized as a key to a century-old scholarly mystery: Why is there no socialism in the United States.\"\n\nHow\n\nBuilding on rich newspaper and manuscript archives across America (e.g. Wisconsin Historical Society, Illinois Historical Society, and Harvard University), this project uncovers letters, pamphlets, newspaper articles, memoirs, diaries and travel accounts to examine previously unexplored Danish-American debates over the ideology of transplanted socialism.\n\nSSR\n\nThe transnational currents of social democracy, class solidarity and white ethnic nationalism, that shaped Louis Pios 19th century world continue to inform debates in Denmark and the U.S. Thus,\nthe project will contribute to renewed reflection and dialogue.",

    "title": "Empire without Alternative? Autocratic Power and Inevitability in the early Roman Empire",
    "summary": "What\n\nMy project offers the first in-depth analysis of whether one-man rule was perceived as inevitable by Roman historians in the early Roman Empire (31BCE-CE117). While imperial ideology, for sure, promoted the idea that one-man rule was the only alternative, there were other voices, too, other historians. Their works, however, have not been read with the approach required to grasp how alternatives to autocracy - i.e. alternatives to the course of events that came to pass - may be activated in historical texts, especially those written under the watchful eye of an emperor. Inspired by recent work on the use of literary devices that activate so-called \"futures past\", I will explore how alternatives to autocracy are activated (or shut down) in historical texts from the early Empire.\n\nWhy\n\nThe inevitability of one-man rule in Rome after the civil wars of the Late Republic was long taken for granted by historians. Consequently, it was generally assumed that the Romans of the Empire were trapped in a world devoid of alternatives, in which autocracy was perceived as an inevitable fact of life. Although this assumption still exerts a powerful influence, it has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. This scrutiny, however, has only partially manifested itself in a reconsideration of the perceptions of the Romans themselves. There is still a lack of research on alternatives to one-man rule in literature from the imperial period, where the assumption still appears to be that such alternatives were inconceivable. This assumption needs to be investigated more critically.\n\nHow\n\nI will put the political horizons of imperial writers under scrutiny by undertaking philological analyses of historical texts. I will explore (i) how the idea of inevitability functions within the imperial truth regime, esp. how failure to acknowledge the inevitability of one-man rule is equated with political incompetence or even treason; and (ii) how alternatives to one-man rule are activated (or shut down) in historical texts, esp. how literary devices may activate alternative (unrealised) futures: debates highlight the decisions with which historical agents grappled, introspection reveals expectations, the relation of rumours implies other possibilities, \"Beinahe-episodes\" suggest that other outcomes were possible, and explicit counterfactuals develop such outcomes.\n\nSSR\n\n2019 was the 14th consecutive year of decline in global freedom. So, at least, is the verdict given by Freedom in the World, the flagship journal of the NGO 'Freedom House'. Rather than harvesting the democratic gains expected from the fall of the USSR, the Arab Spring, and the expansion of the EU, we find ourselves in the midst of a resurgence of autocracy. In Hungary, in Russia, in Turkey, in Brazil, in Poland, even in the US, we find a similar rhetoric: democratic institutions are too feeble and too inefficient to handle a crisis, and only a strong leader, unfettered by constitutional constraints, can guarantee peace and security. Scholarly interest in regime change has developed in tandem with this political development. While in the 1990s scholars were laying out trajectories of democratisation, the beginning of the 21st century has witnessed a renaissance of research on autocracy: on how it feeds on the fear of chaos, undermines the system it supposedly seeks to restore, and presents itself as the only option. As noted by Dukalskis and Gerschewski (2017), \"there is great power\", after all, \"in a regime making itself appear inevitable because it renders overt, declared opposition irrational\". It's about time this research took into account the most durable autocracy in European history: The Roman Empire. EWA, then, is a timely reaction to contemporary anxieties about a return to autocracy and a reminder of the ease with which formerly unthinkable political positions tend to be normalised in times of crisis.",

    "title": "The role of membrane vesicles in bacterial resistance to antimicrobials and their potential for targeted therapeutic interventions",
    "summary": "What\n\nBacterial and host membrane vesicles (MVs) play important roles during infection. Whereas host MVs are released in response to bacteria and may bind and neutralise bacterial toxins, bacterial MVs may counteract detrimental host responses, bind and disable various antibiotics, and may play a role in antibiotic resistance. \nAntimicrobial host defence peptides (HDPs) are regarded as very promising alternatives to antibiotics. However, it is unknown whether MVs may bind and incapacitate HDPs as well. Therefore, in this project we will focus on understanding the interplay between HDPs and MVs during infection. Additionally, we will study specificity of host MVs, as well as bacterial MVs from different strains, to explore their potential for targeted delivery of antimicrobials.\n\nWhy\n\nAntibiotic resistance development in bacteria has become an increasing issue in human medicine, animal husbandry and agriculture. As more antibiotics have become ineffective, focus has shifted towards alternative antimicrobial therapies such as HDPs, which may not only kill a broad spectrum of microbes, including multi-resistant strains, but also modulate host inflammatory responses. However, the antimicrobial activity of many HDPs is compromised under physiological conditions. Moreover, pathogenic bacteria may mimic the formation of HDPs to evade host responses. Therefore, the use of HDPs as antimicrobials is not as straightforward as once thought, and understanding extracellular resistance mechanisms of bacteria towards the antimicrobial activity of HDPs is essential.\n\nHow\n\nIn order to address the roles of host and bacterial MVs in relation to the function of HDPs, we will investigate the effect of various HDPs on bacterial and host MV release, composition and function. We will also investigate how binding of HDPs to these vesicles affect the biological activity of the peptides. For this purpose, we will use a broad range of methods within physical chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, immunology, microscopy, and proteomics. Furthermore, we will investigate how HDP-MV binding affect bacterial recognition and antibacterial responses by host cells. Finally, we will investigate the existence of species selectivity of MVs.\n\nSSR\n\nWith the post-antibiotic era on our doorstep, investigating extracellular resistance mechanisms of bacteria towards potential alternatives to antibiotics, such as host defence peptides, is crucial. \nThe results of this project will significantly increase our understanding of the interplay between HDPs and MVs, as well as between the host and bacterial MVs. This in turn may lead to novel targets and methods for combatting infections unresponsive to current antibiotic treatment strategies. In addition, it may provide important clues to support the development of HDPs into next generation antimicrobials.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe book explores the nexus between Nordic Lutheranism and societal developments of the 18th century. It investigates the agency of theologians and theological ideas in effecting change within the legal practice. More specifically, the book centers on the abolition of religious authority in questions of jurisprudence and a departure from the use of Biblical texts as judicial precepts (so-called Mosaic Law) in criminal cases in Denmark-Norway and Iceland.\n\nWhy\n\nThe book offers new insights concerning the differentiation between theology and law in public administration, as well as of the role of Lutheran theologies in the process of secularization in Western Scandinavia. Previous literature on legal developments and reform in 18th-century Scandinavia is dominated by scholars using legal and enlightenment philosophy, legislation - or legislators' agency - as the point of departure for describing a top-down process of change. This book takes a different approach.\n\nHow\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, it became common practice for Kings to request expert opinions from theological professors at the University of Copenhagen prior to making final decisions regarding the most serious, complex, and critical of criminal cases, especially those in which the death penalty was involved. Using the theologians' responses within actual court cases, supplemented by sources pertaining to these cases from both the lower courts and the Supreme Court, the book explores the consequences of shifting theologies on legal practice and factual process of change.\n\nSSR\n\nThe question of religion and legal practice has reemerged in public debate. The book will provide an enhanced understanding of the religious preconditions of the Nordic societal model, informing present and future debates.",

    "title": "GLOBAL SEX - Seeing Human Trafficking from the Global South",
    "summary": "What\n\nGlobal Sex draws on unique longitudinal data I have collected over nearly two decades of anthropological research on migration, women, sex work and trafficking. I filled my first notebook in a Danish brothel at Thy in 2003. My last notebook was completed in spring of 2020, when coronavirus began altering the lives of the migrant women among whom I had been working. Global Sex intends to take the reader on a journey across borders and behind doors in Asia, Africa, Europe and Denmark in order to understand migration and human trafficking for sex work from the perspectives of the women involved. By including the voices of the women themselves and their communities, I hope to offer a more holistic and visionary approach to trafficking and women's migration.\n\nWhy\n\nBuilding on contemporary critical migration and trafficking studies, I suggest that the precise point at which tolerable forms of sex-work migration end and human trafficking begins vary in accordance with different political and moral values that are not easily captured by legal definitions. Rather, I intend to show how questions of exploitation and voluntariness often circle around complex questions of consent within specific cultural contexts and along migration routes. By means of my data I am able to demonstrate that contemporary female migration and human trafficking cannot be understood without recognizing that \"sex as a global commodity\" is a key to these women accessing money, work and immigration papers.\n\nHow\n\nMy method has been to follow \"sex as a commodity\". Asking \"why, how and where?\", I have followed people as they travel from one side of the globe to the other to buy or sell sex: from Thai massage parlors in Thy in Denmark to the Red-Light District of Istedgade in Copenhagen, and from sex tourists in Pattaya to undocumented Nigerian women migrants crossing the Mediterranean to sell sex in Europe. Since 2003 I have stayed in continual contact with these localities, thus enabling me to adopt a longitudinal approach, as well as interviewing more than a hundred women.\n\nSSR\n\nThe trafficking of women into the sex industries of the EU and Denmark has received increasing scholarly and political attention, as well as being seen as a significant societal challenge. Despite this attention, however, one hitherto neglected but important question is how these types of migration influence the communities in the Global South from which women's migration to the sex industries of the Global North continues to be rampant.\nIn Global Sex, I break with those earlier studies that have been focused on the places, such as in Denmark, where human trafficking is conducted to show instead what is at stake in the local communities from which the women come.",

    "title": "I-HANK: The International Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian model",
    "summary": "What\n\nWhy are booms and busts in economic activity so closely connected across countries? While this question is crucial for designing stabilization policies, it has challenged international macroeconomists for decades. An emerging literature studies business cycles through the lens of macroeconomic models featuring heterogeneity in income and wealth levels across households. Such Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models establish a link between distributional issues and macroeconomic outcomes. With very few exceptions, however, the existing literature has focused on models of closed economies. The aim of this project is to develop an International HANK model (I-HANK), and investigate the hypothesis that such a model can explain the international co-movement of business cycles.\n\nWhy\n\nOne explanation for the international co-movement of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across countries is that some of the driving forces behind economic fluctuations - such as the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic - are cross-border phenomena in nature. Another explanation is that countries trade with each other, thus transmitting booms or recessions to their trading partners. Yet, existing economic models that reflect these facts still struggle to account for the high degrees of co-movement of GDP observed across industrialized countries. This means that existing models tend to understate the importance of foreign economic developments for small open economies such as Denmark. In turn, this may lead to misguided economic policy recommendations.\n\nHow\n\nThe research project has two main components; one empirical and one theoretical. The empirical component aims at extending our knowledge about the international co-movement of business cycles by collecting and analyzing new data on how disaggregated and distributional business-cycle statistics are correlated across countries. The theoretical component focuses directly on the development of the new I-HANK model and on analyzing its ability to explain the international co-movement of business cycles. To maximize the impact of the project, I wish to establish an international network of young researchers to provide the basis for a broader research programme within this area. As a part in this, two PhD students and one postdoc will be hired to work on the project.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project will lead to better and more accurate economic models that take the feedback loop between income inequality and macroeconomic outcomes into account. Thus, it will contribute to better and more realistic model-based economic policy recommendations, benefiting society as such.",

    "summary": "What\n\nMy research compares Danish and French commemorations of defeat following the German Wars of Unification (1864-1871) as a means of placing Danish memory politics within an international context. The goal of this project is to create a novel comparative analysis that places Danish monuments to 1864 within the broader practice of commemorating Lost Causes - failed revolutions, ceded territories, and lost battles - whose veneration in nationalist memory politics set the stage for WWI. The development of the international cult of Lost Causes and Denmark's position within it can be understood through the co-sharing of symbols of defeat in late-nineteenth century monuments, which my research highlights through the study of Antonin Mercié's Gloria Victis (c. 1873), or \"Glory to the Vanquished.\"\n\nWhy\n\nThe study of societal memory of difficult heritage has become an important meeting-point for interdisciplinary research in Europe. While Denmark has been an important contributor to the field of memory studies on both a local and international level, the Danish experience of the loss of 1864 remains largely absent from international discourse on the memory of 19th-century global conflicts. My project takes the unique position of studying nationalist memories of defeat within the context of international commemorative trends and Lost Cause ideologies in order to amplify the visibility of Danish research and to understand Danish commemorative practices within a larger network of European memory.\n\nHow\n\nBy the end of this project in 2023, the outcome will be both the publication of a new book on a previously unpublished topic, as well as the development of a Danish-French research network pioneering new research on global representations of defeat. In France, I will be hosted by University Paris Nanterre's research unit, History of Arts and Representations (HAR). Book research will be archival, using resources from the National Institute of Art History (INHA) in tangent with local municipal records from the places where these monuments are located. The project will finalize with an international virtual seminar series led by the Danish-French network.\n\nSSR\n\nThe manipulation of cultural memory for political purposes is an increasingly dangerous problem today, especially within populist governments in Europe and the Americas. The erasure of monuments,  government hijackings of museums and universities for the espousal of \"new historical truths,\"  and the use of state-sanctioned violence in the name of protecting cultural heritage,  are all signs of the extinguishing of traditional humanistic values in the West. As in the past, the rise of illiberal and nativist political forces today depends upon the Lost Cause ethos of victimization and the desire to return to an idyllic past. If the way a society views the past is a mirror onto the present, then the study of the commemorative trends leading up to the First World War, as signs of the real horrors to come, might serve as a warning of what dangers global society faces today.",

    "title": "Passage to bicameralism? Probing Europe's legislative power",
    "summary": "What\n\nUniquely among international organizations, the European Union (EU) has the power to make laws that are directly binding upon its member-states. Since the 1980s, a system of bicameral lawmaking has emerged with the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers at the center of the EU's legislative power. Why do EU lawmakers routinely reach legislative compromises behind closed doors even as they have committed themselves to open and public lawmaking? And, by implication, to what extent has the growing legislative power of the European Parliament contributed to democratizing the EU polity? PASSAGE TO BICAMERALISM inserts itself in a pressing debate on European democracy with a comparative-historical analysis of EU legislative power.\n\nWhy\n\nThe EU's legislative power is widely viewed as a pillar of rules-based regional governance as well as a means to promote a European form of liberalism at the global level. At the same time, it has fueled some of the most bitter political controversies in the EU, as evidenced by the Brexit slogan of 'taking back control over our laws', and a wider sense that, perhaps, the EU is overstepping its legislative prerogative. In addressing these questions, the book contributes to our knowledge of how democratic processes can develop and be sustained in an economically integrated but politically fragmented polity, and why the power to make laws remains centrally important to the European continent. It will also contribute insights bridging studies of the EU, lawmaking and negotiation practices.\n\nHow\n\nThe analysis of EU lawmaking institutions is embedded in a comparative-historical conceptual framework, with a specific reference to the U.S. experience of bicameralism. Drawing on a rich, original empirical material on EU lawmaking, the monograph charts the development of bicameral institutions in the EU, identifying key changes in procedure and in practice. It then probes the causal mechanisms underpinning change, paying special attention to whether and how the crises of the last decade have been engines of change. The study of EU legislators' response is supplemented by a cursory analysis of U.S. responses. This will produce a clearer and more accurate picture of what is 'unique' and 'not so unique' about the development of EU lawmaking institutions.\n\nSSR\n\nLawmaking processes are of signal importance for democracies; EU laws are the foundation of the single market. The project's analytical tools and comparative perspective will enhance our\nunderstanding of EU lawmaking and the challenges ahead.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThis project studies the so-called 'Ghetto Plan' which aims to rid Denmark of 'ghettos' - social housing areas that meet criteria regarding resident employment, education, income, crime and 'non-Western' immigration - by 2030. The policy means that much social housing will be sold to private investors and many residents will be displaced in pursuit of 'social mixing'. However, the policy is being met with critique and resistance outside parliament, notably from the grassroots network Almen Modstand (Common Resistance). This project asks (1) how social housing, marketization, and governance are interlinked in the policy, and (2) how the policy affects residents in their everyday lives and how they resist it.\n\nWhy\n\nThe project hypothesizes, first, that the 'Ghetto Plan' can be understood as a process of state-led gentrification made possible, in part, through 'territorial stigmatization' and involving both 'rent gaps' and governance of, what I propose to call, 'civic gaps'. The aim is to contribute to the field of gentrification research with a rigorous explanatory model that involves both market and governance, economy and culture, rather than reducing these to competing frameworks. Second, the project hypothesizes that the case presents a complex web of both organized and everyday resistance, in which ethnicity is a crucial factor. This holds the promise of a contribution to the burgeoning debates on resistance to gentrification and territorial stigma.\n\nHow\n\nWith an interdisciplinary approach drawing on human geography and sociology, the project will combine a rigorous theoretical approach with various forms of empirical data. The latter will include grey literature concerning the 'Ghetto Plan' and its implementation; media articles on the 'ghetto' debate; data generated through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders; and field notes from participant observation of Almen Modstand's activities, such as demonstrations, workshops, and meetings.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project will produce knowledge about the motivation for and consequences of a contested social policy that has been dubbed 'the social experiment of the century'. The aim is for this knowledge to be useful for various stakeholders, including social housing residents and politicians, and contribute to the public debate about housing and urban development in Denmark.",

The Razorbills on Græsholmen were generally living under very good conditions during the study years (1983-2011). Annual survival rates for adult breeding birds (93-95%) and for young birds to the age of first breeding (4Y, 57.7%) were among the highest recorded in any study. Mean annual breeding success (73%) was also high. The rate of annual adult nonbreeding was low (3%).\n\nThe high number of 1-2Y birds visiting Græsholmen and the relatively high numbers of birds starting to breed when 3 years old also suggest good conditions for the breeding population.",

    "title": "Tracking the delivery of volatile elements to terrestrial planets",
    "summary": "What\n\nPerhaps one of the most fundamental questions in natural sciences is the origin of life in our Solar System and how likely it is to be found elsewhere. What is clear is that a keystone to the formation of life is the presence of water-bearing planets in the habitable zone around stars. However, it is not clear if the formation of these Earth-like planets that bear the complex chemistry critical to life is a rare chance occurrence or the natural outcome of star and planet formation.\n\nWhy\n\nTraditionally planet formation is thought to occur relatively slow via collisions between ever larger proto-planets. In this model, volatiles and complex chemistry critical to life arrive late and their delivery is subject to a chance encounter. Recent images of disks around young stars and simulations of planet formation have led to a paradigm shift. Planets are now thought to grow fast, primarily driven by accretion of millimeter-sized particles. This paradigm shift raises the possibility that delivery of volatiles and complex chemistry critical to life is a common outcome of planet formation, implying that water worlds may be common in the galaxy. Thus, better understanding of the timing of delivery of volatiles to the Earth has broad implications for the likelihood of life elsewhere.\n\nHow\n\nPlanetary processes have made it impossible to determine the timing and origin of their volatile elements. However, this information can be obtained from chondrules, millimetre-sized spherical objects found in primitive meteorites. Critically, chondrules formed throughout the growth of the planets and, as such, each chondrule provides a snapshot of their environment. We will take advantage of this by determining the chemical and isotopic fingerprints of elements with distinct redox behaviour in age dated chondrules, which will allow us to establish when volatile elements were delivered to Earth's feeding zone.\n\nSSR\n\nSince the beginning, humankind has been fascinated by the stars and wondered if there is life elsewhere in this universe. This research is a minute steppingstone on the path towards addressing this question and many more steps will have to be taken. Thus, I am fully committed to the important missions of student education and public outreach. This project will contribute to the education of our next generation of scientists and results will be communicated to the public through, for example, exhibits at the new Natural History Museum of Denmark.",

    "title": "Investigating the role of enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in atrial fibrillation",
    "summary": "What\n\nAtrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder worldwide. An enhanced inflammatory response is commonly observed in patients with atrial fibrillation and increased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines are found to positively correlated with the progression of the disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key inflammatory signalling complex that regulates innate immunity and serves as an inflammatory signalling-amplifier regulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies demonstrated that the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome is increased in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation. However, the precise role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and signalling in atrial fibrillation pathogenesis remains elusive.\n\nWhy\n\nDespite the high prevalence of atrial fibrillation, the available treatment strategies are inadequate and there is a need for safer and more efficacious treatment options. The most prominent explanation for the lack of new medicine is the high number of factors promoting atrial fibrillation as well as a limited understanding of this complex disease and its progression. The overall aim of this research project is to establish how the inflammatory signalling complex, the NLRP3 inflammasome, is involved in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation.\n\nHow\n\nThe work outlined in this project will be conducted in Prof. Dobromir Dobrev's laboratory at the Institute of Pharmacology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. Prior to initiating this project at University of Duisburg-Essen, I will, in collaboration with Prof. Thomas Jespersen's team at the University of Copenhagen generate a tachypacing-induced large animal model of atrial fibrillation, which will enable me to use these heart samples during my two-year postdoctoral stay at University of Duisburg-Essen.\n\nSSR\n\nAtrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder worldwide affecting more than 33.5 million and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of atrial fibrillation is increasing the burden on the public health care systems worldwide, why current treatment options need to be improved. With this fellowship, I will deliver important novel insights, facilitating development of a new, safe and effective therapeutic treatment regimens for atrial fibrillation patients.",

    "title": "International Law-Making: Actors in Shipping and Climate Change (InterAct)",
    "summary": "What\n\nInterAct aims to provide an account of the actors involved in the international law-making processes addressing climate change impacts of shipping, elucidating about their role and the incentives, barriers, interactions and synergies for sustainable shipping. InterAct will contribute to new academic insights into the theory of actors in international law and law-making, while providing an understanding and a way forward to address maritime transport climate-related impacts.\n\nWhy\n\nIf they could be accounted as a country, greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport would be one of the top ten world largest emitters. Moreover, shipping emissions are forecasted to increase 50%-250% by 2050 and the contribution of shipping to climate change will further intensify, as routes in the Arctic become available. In spite of this, shipping remains largely unregulated, being the last sector of the economy to contribute to climate change mitigation targets in line with the Paris Agreement. In understanding this anomaly, the literature has looked into different aspects and dynamics of the regulation of shipping, but a key component has lingered unexplored, namely, the role of different actors in climate-related law-making for the sector, which InterAct will explore.\n\nHow\n\nInterAct's main objective will be addressed through two sub-projects, which deal with two convergent objectives: 1) Understanding the role of actors in law-making processes regarding market-based measures and technology and energy transition for international maritime transport; and\n2) Understanding the role of actors in the regulation of shipping induced climate change in the Arctic (Sub-project 2). InterAct adopts the use of research methodologies (semi-structured interviews and surveys to relevant actors) beyond the traditional legal method, which will be also complemented with insights from other disciplines to contextualize the legal research. The project covers a period of three years from 1st September 2021 to 31st August 2024.\n\nSSR\n\nInterAct aims to contribute to a sustainable low-carbon future for shipping through world-class research. The project includes a range of activities (workshops and conferences) targeting the scientific community and stakeholders, such as businesses, the public sector and policy-makers, to present and discuss the research results. InterAct's outputs will be made available to the general public.",

    "title": "Masculine Identities in Classical Greece",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project explores the construction of masculine identity in a set of Classical Greek texts (Homer, Sophocles and Plato) in which men identify with or appropriate roles that are culturally defined as female. This identification with the female is closely connected to a position of critique or opposition. To take a female role is also to adopt a different set of values, otherwise considered unmanly: passivity, love and receptivity as the basis of a different relation between self and world. In this way, the texts challenge, criticise and negotiate normative masculinity through behaviour which is characteristically un-manly. The project aims to uncover how such feminine behaviour influences and constructs notions of self and identity.\n\nWhy\n\nBesides contributing with new knowledge about the specific texts it examines, the project offers new insight into an aspect of Ancient Greek masculine identity which has been largely ignored by scholars. While traditional accounts of Greek sexuality and personhood focus strongly on dominant norms and ideals, this project focuses on behaviour that falls outside these norms. The project thus changes and broadens our understanding of Greek masculinity and the history of the male subject. Because of the importance of the ancient Greek evidence in all later discussions of European identity, gender and sexuality, the outcome of the project will be important to a range of other fields, such as philosophy, sociology and gender studies.\n\nHow\n\nThe project is based on readings of well-known, canonical texts. It will result in a series of articles, each devoted to an individual text. Its novelty lies in its approach, which is partly  described above. Theoretically, queer theory and theory of affect are important to the study, offering models for evaluating the type of gender non-conformity we find in the texts.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project partakes in a struggle to diversify research in classics by looking closer at aspects and marginalised or ignored subject-positions in antiquity. Greek and Roman classics have played a key role in the formation of European identity and have, furthermore, been at the centre of modern discussions about gender and sexuality (notably in Foucault's History of Sexuality). By changing and nuancing our understanding of how gender and identity relate in ancient Greece, the project ultimately seeks to deepen our understanding of these topics today.",

Despite the close proximity, we know very little about the ecology of non-human city dwellers. In and on the soil under our feet, as much as ¼ of living diversity on Earth may be found, including invertebrates such as ants, beetles and spiders. They have adapted to a multitude of microhabitats and microclimates and deliver important ecosystem services, such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. I aim to investigate how ground-foraging and soil-dwelling invertebrates are affected by global change and whether participating in scientific projects affects children's nature relatedness and interest in science.\n\nWhy\n\nForecasts of future development predict that by 2030 urban land cover could almost triple compared to 2000 and human activities are likely to increase global temperatures by 1.5 °C by 2030-2052 compared to pre-industrial levels. These changes may result in the alteration of species communities as some species adapt and thrive, others move to environments that are more suitable, new species arrive and some species go extinct. However, predicting which species will react in which way and mitigating the effects of global change are challenging tasks. Cities may hold the key. Because of the urban heat-island effect, cities are often warmer than their surroundings, providing a unique opportunity to use cities as space-for-time experiments on the effects of future global change.\n\nHow\n\nThe research will be carried out as a citizen science project, where families and schools conduct the experiments. Participants will set up pit fall traps, conduct baiting experiments, measure decomposition rates and collect environmental data using microclimate loggers. Invertebrate communities will be characterised based on diversity, abundance and biomass and the effects of factors such as temperature, soil moisture, urbanisation, plant cover and species interactions will be investigated. To determine the effects of participating in scientific projects, participants and a non-participating control group will answer surveys about their relation to nature and science interests before and after participating.\n\nSSR\n\nAs urbanization increases, it is important to create socially and ecologically sustainable cities. In some cities, domestic gardens account for 25 % of land area. These gardens are often the most substantial pieces of land that the public control and engage with directly. Through soil management and planting, people can manipulate local microclimate and the species they attract. Interaction with gardens may be of great importance for fostering interest and support for biodiversity, in a time when alienation from nature is becoming increasingly common. This project will help raise awareness of the effects of urbanisation and climate change on biodiversity and enable people to make informed decisions on how to manage gardens for native biodiversity. \n\nThe project directly addresses several of the sustainable development goals, especially the protection and promotion of sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and the halt of biodiversity loss (goal 15), and awareness raising and education on climate change mitigation and adaptation (goal 13). However, the project also contributes to goal 3, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for people of all ages and goal 4, ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.",

    "title": "A Philosophy of Ambient Sound: Materiality, Technology, Art and the Sonic Environment",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project is a media philosophical and historical study of sound as environment. It explores how an 'environmentalization' of sound has been as a guiding principle in auditory culture from the 19th century to current digital culture and how this long and multifaceted process has influenced the way we understand, use and experience sound today - in advanced media technologies, in sound-oriented art, film and design, and in everyday listening and communication. What does it mean to be affected by sound as environment and not as a set of individual sounds in the environment? How is sound 'staged' as a surrounding environment in different periods and in different fields of practice? How does the environmentalization of sound affect the way we listen, think and communicate?\n\nWhy\n\nEnvironmental sound has been an object of attention in sound studies and sound art for decades. There has been a tendency, however, to reduce the sonic environment to a style or genre in recent music and sound art. With this project I will present another perspective in which environmental sound and ambient sonic practices are seen as essential components of modern and contemporary culture that permeates our engagement with sound on a much deeper level. Furthermore, with this approach I also wish to explore broader cultural issues by showing how environmentalization of sound has induced new modes of listening, new forms of communication and new forms of individual, social and political life in a deeply mediatized culture.\n\nHow\n\nThe project is a result of my decade-long research into media philosophy and environmental aesthetics. With the Carlsberg Monograph Fellowship I am grateful for the opportunity to develop this research further in a monograph format. In the book, I will focus on four key aspects of sound as environment: sonic materials; listening technologies; forms of sonic environments; and ambient modes of listening. By introducing concepts such as 'sonic mediatization', 'encapsulation', 'encircling' and 'the distraction-immersion axis', the book presents a conceptual framework for analyzing environmental sound and ambient practices in different areas of sonic culture including music production, sound art, film sound, background music, sonic streaming, and mobile listening in everyday auditory culture.\n\nSSR\n\nSonic environments and how we engage with them have gained increasing cultural significance in art, media and everyday life in the 21st century. The project contributes to aspects of Social Scientific Responsibility by exploring the ways in which this process takes place and how it affects our experience, understanding and communicative practice with sound. Furthermore, it is the project's ambition to help elucidating broader contemporary psychological, social and political challenges emerging with mediatized forms of experience and communication. This includes issues such as attention difficulties; social and environmental disengagement; consequences of uninterrupted, peripheral and repetitive communication; and the role of aesthetics in the development of information bubbles.",

    "title": "Exploring the potential of nonparametric modelling of complex systems via stochastic partial differential equations",
    "summary": "What\n\nGiven the ubiquitous use of mathematical models in almost all areas of our lives, it is essential that modelling is carried out with the greatest care, especially in sensitive applications such as the disposal of radioactive waste where one needs to assess the risk of scenarios like radionuclide transport. The standard approach of using partial differential equations (PDEs) to model physical processes like the groundwater flow is not always adequate (e.g., when the flow also depends in a complicated way on microscopic properties of the medium). Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) consider such phenomena and mathematically generalize PDEs. This project aims at exploring the potential of SPDE models and providing basic statistical methods facilitating their use in practice.\n\nWhy\n\nFor many mathematical models, it has proven to be very rewarding to integrate randomness, thus accounting for hidden random dynamics, measurement errors and other external influences. In various applications, randomness can easily be reflected in the model by simply adding \"noise\", i.e., a stochastic component. However, for a whole class of highly relevant models, namely those based on PDEs, considering noise naturally leads to SPDEs that are mathematically very complex. As a result, despite the evidence that SPDE models are highly relevant, these models are largely overlooked due to a lack of understanding and a lack of feasible tools for their statistical analysis. Our goal is to contribute to closing this gap, thereby reducing the entry barrier for SPDEs in real world scenarios.\n\nHow\n\nThe SPDE model is determined by characteristics that are unknown in practice. We focus on statistical methods for estimating these characteristics, i.e., we mathematically investigate general methods to learn the parameters from the available data. Furthermore, we want to identify criteria and provide a mathematical framework that will allow deciding whether modelling with SPDEs is appropriate in a given situation. As a result, we expect to provide procedures and to legitimate them by mathematically proving their efficiency in terms of common risk measures.\n\nSSR\n\nOur research will provide techniques leading to a better understanding of complex systems modelled via SPDEs in various scientific fields such as medicine, ecology or natural sciences in general. This will help to make more effective decisions on very important issues affecting society as a whole, such as the fight against cancer, pollution or climate change, to name but a few of many other issues. As mathematicians, we strive to provide the tools for understanding and progress in other disciplines. I see it as my personal responsibility to use my knowledge to contribute to creating accurate mathematical models that provide reliable information, especially in sensitive applications, and to increase awareness of such issues.",

    "title": "FIDUCIA: The theological roots of Danish trust culture undergirding the welfare state",
    "summary": "What\n\nFIDUCIA explores potential influences of Lutheran theology on the development of Danish trust culture. The Danish welfare state is characterised by high levels of social and institutional trust, which nourish a socially cohesive society with low corruption, a minimum of bureaucracy, and limited 'free-riding', despite high taxes. This trust culture has attracted considerable international attention, but little is known about its historical background. FIDUCIA unearths the possible theological roots hereof, examining how theological social imaginaries of trust might have affected how Danes related to fellow citizens, societal institutions, and state authorities as Denmark developed from an absolutist kingdom to a nascent liberal democratic welfare state from the mid-19th century onwards.\n\nWhy\n\nFIDUCIA investigates the interplay between confessional culture and societal development by pioneering the question of theological influence on Danish trust culture and welfare state formation. FIDUCIA broadens the scope of welfare state research to include theological determinants and contributes to the budding interdisciplinary research on trust in which a theological perspective, despite its obviousness has not yet been applied. Additionally, FIDUCIA rethinks systematic theology to include conceptual analyses of trust central to both theology and society in an approach of 'theological conceptual history', which facilitates research on the complex connection between theological theorising and societal development.\n\nHow\n\nFIDUCIA analyses a variety of material (e.g. legislation, theological texts, contributions to the public debate) and examines changes in the dynamics of trust in God, state authorities, and citizens, focusing on three historical cases: 1) The 1830s and 40s, when the absolutist kingdom evolved into a democracy and citizens arose as trustworthy authorities with constitutional rights and obligations, potentially challenging the trust relation between king and people; 2) The 1930s and 40s, when social reforms secured rights to benefits, and the threat and realisation of German occupation challenged the Danish democracy and nascent welfare state, endangering social trust; 3) The formation of the genuine welfare state in the late 1960s and early 70s, when social benefits were extended to all.\n\nSSR\n\nFIDUCIA answers to an impending international trust crisis. Trust in politicians, democratic institutions, and general community has decreased, the corona and climate crises challenge the fundamental trust in a sustainable future, and trust culture and trust-based democratic societies can no longer be taken for granted. In-depth knowledge of the religious background for Danish trust culture will help us understand the historical development of the trust culture undergirding the welfare state and, potentially, contribute to its future persistence. The historical examination serves as background for a contemporary perspective examining to what extent social imaginaries of trust rooted in Lutheran theology continue to nourish a trust mentality in one of the world's allegedly most secularized countries.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe aim is to provide solutions for future sustainable food production in rainfed and semi-arid regions. By promoting development of perennial grain crops for food and feed production, the soil sequestration of carbon will be dramatically increased. Likewise, more frequent seasonal climate extremes call for drought resistant crops of high nutritional value which can produce a robust yield in semi-arid regions. To address these challenges, our research will focus on two crops: (1) Improving grain quality and yield in wheatgrass, a perennial grass closely related to wheat. (2) Enhancing the yield, nutritional quality and disease and drought resistance in sorghum.\n\nWhy\n\nWe will conduct an in-depth analysis of biosynthetic pathways in plants activated under stress conditions e.g. heat and drought. Likewise, the synthesis of proteins, carbohydrates, cell walls and bioactive natural substances will be investigated particularly in grains, with special emphasis on sorghum and wheatgrass. The study includes of the genetic gain obtained through millenniums of plant selection in forming the modern crop species grown today. These studies allow identification of major genes for drought tolerance, grain quality and yield to select rare genetic variants in sorghum and wheatgrass populations with large genetic diversity. The identified plants will significantly add to the knowledge on the plasticity of plant genetics and biochemistry in changing climates.\n\nHow\n\nThe project is carried out as an open collaboration between various world-leading partners e.g. the Plant Biochemistry Laboratory at the University of Copenhagen (Professor Birger Lindberg Møller), The Innovation in Agriculture laboratory at Queensland University in Australia (Professor Robert Henry), The Land Institute, (Dr. Lee DeHaan) in the USA and the Carlsberg Research Laboratory. By combining knowledge from the laboratories involved, great synergies are achieved, as the partners involved contribute with very different competencies, all at a very high professional level. It is planned to file patents covering the commercial aspects of the gained results followed by publishing in high ranking journals.\n\nSSR\n\nClimate change is already underway and the development of new plant crops with new characteristics is taking a long time. The project will show the way to ensure and accelerate the production of sustainable food under future difficult production conditions. The research will contribute new specific knowledge on plant genetics and their significance for drought tolerance, grain quality and yield. This knowledge is essential for a deep understanding of the genetic control of the biochemical pathways essential for the breeding of future cultivated plants. Subsequently, the developed varieties will enable a more sustainable production under the challenging climatic conditions of the coming decades globally for the benefit of the societies globally as well as local.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe cattle-like wild oxen species banteng - Bos javanicus and gaur - Bos gaurus are going extinct and we know almost nothing about them. This project will generate full nuclear genomes from museum specimens of extinct populations, and in combination with modern specimens investigate species structure, as well as evolution across time and geography. This information will be used in conservation efforts of both species. The project will further identify specific genes under selection over time, these gene variants may be useful adaptations, with potential for optimisation of health, production and sustainability in cattle industry. In short, using museum specimens to investigate natural history and evolution, with implications for wildlife conservation and cattle industry.\n\nWhy\n\nThe world is in a biodiversity crisis, these scientific results have great implications to conserve species, ecosystems and biodiversity. Which is a fantastic thing on its own but also conserve ecosystem services that millions of people depend on. Further the project will provide novel knowledge about evolution and natural history of the target species. Finally, unique adaptive gene versions in banteng and gaur are evolutionary innovation, which is a resource with implications in cattle industry, advancing and improving an enormous industry that need optimisation. Doing this makes the project an inspiring lead example of using evolutionary-historical research in food production.\n\nHow\n\nPublished research and the host institution allow access to modern reference data. The first step of the project is therefore to generate full nuclear genomes of historical specimens, obtained from museums. Once the dataset include all necessary populations, supercomputers are used to explore the data and identify structure, divergent linages and admixture.

    "title": "Assessing the influence of cosmic rays on clouds",
    "summary": "What\n\nThis project sets out to gauge the atmospheric relevance of a potential cloud production mechanism that has recently been demonstrated in the laboratory. If important, this mechanism links galactic cosmic rays, originating from supernova explosions in the Milky Way, to Earth's climate. Correlations between cosmic rays and clouds have been observed, but scientific convergence on their implications has been missing, as no direct microphysical mechanism linking cosmic rays to clouds was known. This has recently changed as laboratory experiments uncovered a physical mechanism, that ties ionization from cosmic rays to cloud formation: Ions have been shown to accelerate the production and growth of nanometer size aerosols towards sizes that allow them to act as seed particles for cloud droplets.\n\nWhy\n\nThe largest uncertainty in estimates of Earth's energy budget stems from clouds and aerosols. Clouds regulate the albedo of our planet, and any systematic modulation of atmospheric aerosol and clouds must be taken into account for us to build a complete picture of climate variability. If cosmic rays affect aerosols through ion production, then that is completely unaccounted for in our current climate models. The atmospheric relevance of this new ion-based aerosol growth mechanism should therefore be quantified. My project aims precisely to investigate wether the ion induced aerosol production and growth mechanism observed in the laboratory can function in the real atmosphere.\n\nHow\n\nThe most practical way to conduct experiments on a global scale is through atmospheric computer models. I will implement the newly found aerosol growth mechanism into ECHAM-HAM, a global circulation aerosol model developed at University of Oxford, and investigate wether it is able to affect aerosol concentrations on a global scale. Cosmic rays and thus atmospheric ionization exhibits natural variation on a range of time scales. These variations may be imposed upon the model, and their consequences for aerosol concentrations monitored. We plan to target weeklong Forbush decreases of the cosmic ray flux, the 11-year solar cycle and millennial scale variations, and describe the response in global and local aerosol concentrations.\n\nSSR\n\nThis projects addresses clouds, the most uncertain area of climate science, by testing a new potentially important cloud forming process. Constraints from this project could reinforce the current assessment from the IPCC that a cosmic-ray cloud connection is weak. Alternatively, it could uncover climate dynamics that are currently not accounted for. Either way, this adds constraints to our understanding of terrestrial climate. So many decisions across the globe rest on the premise that we understand the current and future state of our atmosphere. Therefore, a precise climate understanding is imperative for our society to meet future challenges.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe aim of my project is to finalize a text edition of the ancient Egyptian medical text Papyrus Louvre-Carlsberg. The papyrus is divided between the Louvre Museum and the Papyrus Carlsberg Collection, and the publication is planned as a collaboration between the two institutions. The manuscript dates to c. 1450 BCE and is the second-longest medical text to survive from ancient Egypt, measuring just over 6 meters in length. The publication of the papyrus will take the form of a classical text edition, consisting of a translation with extensive commentary, in addition to a more easily accessible monograph discussing the content of the text, intended for specialists and non-specialists alike.\n\nWhy\n\nPapyrus Louvre-Carlsberg is one of less than a few dozen medical papyri preserved from 3000+ years of ancient Egyptian history and the second-longest text to boot. The manuscript significantly increases the available source material and adds considerably to our knowledge of the ancient science. For instance, it contains the earliest and one of the only embalming handbooks surviving from Egypt, which provides information on the practicalities of mummification and burial. In addition, the papyrus contains the world’s earliest herbal treatise, likewise a strongly underrepresented genre in the ancient sources. As such, the publication of the papyrus will bring much new information to the study of ancient Egyptian medicine specifically and to the history of medicine and science more generally.\n\nHow\n\nTranslating texts from one language to another is fraught with difficulties because no one-to-one correlation exists between any two languages. Translation is often further complicated by cultural differences between source and receptor, which is naturally amplified when attempting to translate millennia-old texts. This cultural and linguistic dependence means that when translating ancient Egyptian medical science, it is pertinent to stay as close to the original text as possible and eschew modern, culture-specific terminology and concepts in order to best reflect the Egyptian scientific principles and to avoid interpretation affecting translation. I therefore take an emic approach in my translation of Papyrus Louvre-Carlsberg.\n\nSSR\n\nWhile grounded firmly in Egyptology and Philology, the publication of the ancient Egyptian medical papyrus is intended for a broad audience. This includes, for instance, showcasing how many of the practices and treatments described in the papyrus remained in use over thousands of years, at least up until 18th century European folk medicine. The consciousness of such a shared scientific origin might aid in providing an increased sense of interconnectedness between Western and Middle Eastern cultures today.",

    "summary": "What\n\nMy project focuses on how we can build more sustainable societies with more intergenerationally just policies. The aim is theoretically informed but empirical and rigorously policy-oriented: to measure and compare intergenerational justice in policy practice across 32 countries: Denmark, its Nordic neighbors, the EU's big three economies (Germany, France and Italy), and the OECD world. Contextually, the project will touch on important contemporary questions of policy sustainability, societal resilience and good governance, related to SDGs 1, 4, 10, 13, and 16.\n\nWhy\n\nThe UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals have increased the global salience of sustainability in public policy. Rising debt levels and inequalities, population aging and the climate crisis have strengthened perceptions that the long-term wellbeing of especially younger and future generations is under threat. However, efforts to measure the intergenerational justice component of sustainability empirically have lagged behind both political and academic debates. How can we improve policies when we only have very incomplete command of the state of affairs in policy practice?  This project aims to provide comparative insights into this key question of governance.\n\nHow\n\nI will delve deep into the measurement of intergenerational justice in the public policy models of many advanced democracies, with multidimensional measures and recent data over a twenty-year period. The unit of analysis will be countries. The multi-indicator empirical analysis will be complemented with in-depth case studies on Denmark, its three fellow Nordic countries, and the EU s three biggest economies, Germany, France, and Italy. The main observational period will be 1995 to 2015, with individual time series data extending beyond this period.\n\nSSR\n\nThis project will address one of the Grand Challenges of our time: how to build more intergeneratinally just societies. It will provide key insights into why some, otherwise comparable, countries can build more intergenerationally just policy models than other countries. It will indicate how political processes and governance cultures contribute to the sustainability of aging societies over the long term. Crucially also, it will give insights for policy reform. For instance, what, if anything, can other rich and/or aging societies learn from the Nordic model?",

In addition to discussions about whether and how different Islamist scenes have changed there has also been a considerable soul-searching about whether past analytical approaches should be rejected, revised and revived to understand the present Islamist scenes. In addition to providing a novel approach to how Islamism can be conceptualized and grasped and an examination of existing theories about various aspects of Islamism, the project does also address the lack of an integrated overview of Middle Eastern Islamism one decade after the Arab uprisings.\n\nHow\n\nThe project will first develop a novel approach to how Islamism can be conceptualized and grasped in a way that goes beyond both (Orientalist) essentialism (reducing Islamism to some Islamic essence) and instrumentalism (where religion is explained away as epiphenomenal). Then, it will zoom in on specific types of Islamism and examine whether and how they have changed significantly during the last decade and discuss the implications for theoretical debates more narrowly linked to the specific type of Islamism in question.

    "title": "Quantum state transduction in a hybrid spin-opto-mechanical system",
    "summary": "What\n\nModern communication and information technologies rely heavily on the use of transducers - devices which enable conversion of signals between different physical modalities (e.g. conversion between electrical and optical signals). However, with the rapid progress in quantum computing, communication and sensing, where the laws of quantum physics can be exploited to tackle problems beyond the reach of existing technologies, a markedly different type of transducers needs to be developed, capable of handling fragile quantum signals.\n\nThis project seeks to develop such a quantum transducer, and study the interactions between optical, mechanical and electronic (i.e., electron spin) modalities in a regime where single quanta of information are shuttled between them.\n\nWhy\n\nTo fully harness the potential of quantum computing, an interconnected network of quantum devices is necessary. Today's leading contenders for quantum computers are based on superconducting electronic circuits, and connecting them over large distances will require efficient conversion between microwave and optical signals, since light can travel over vast distances with little attenuation.\n\nA number of proposed interconnect architectures rely on the use of phonons (quanta of vibrations) as information carriers at the nodes of the network, due to their ability to interact with a wide range of quantum systems. Therefore, understanding how phonons interact with electronic and optical degrees of freedom in a quantum device, and engineering these interactions is of significant importance.\n\nHow\n\nThe transducer at the heart of this project will be based on silicon carbide (SiC), a widely used semiconductor material in the high-power electronics industry. In addition to having excellent optical and mechanical properties, SiC also hosts a family of defects in its crystal structure, which act as artificial atoms. Importantly, the electron spin of a single defect can be used as a quantum bit (qubit), the state of which can be measured by optical means.\nPerforming high-fidelity measurements of the qubit and, in parallel, of a vibrational mode of the device, constitute some of the first steps in this project. These will allow us to study the influence of vibrations on the qubit state and vice versa, and ultimately demonstrate quantum transduction between a spin qubit and mechanics.\n\nSSR\n\nWhile several aspects of this research project can aid our understanding of fundamental physics, the outcomes of the project also hold the potential for breakthroughs in quantum communication, sensing and information technologies. Quantum computing at large is expected to revolutionise several existing industries, with prospective applications ranging from drug and vaccine design, tackling of energy consumption and distribution problems, to \"unhackable\" new communication methods, secured by the laws of physics. We can therefore expect the emergence of this new technology to have a tangible impact on our society.",

    "title": "Long-Term Ownership and Value Creation in Enterprise Foundations",
    "summary": "What\n\nThe project examines how enterprise foundations contribute to business and society through long-term ownership. Enterprise foundations (Erhvervsfonde) are foundations, which own companies. This ownership structure is unique because it combines nonprofit charity in the foundations with for profit business enterprise and thus poses many interesting questions concerning corporate governance. Examples are prominent international companies like Carlsberg, Robert Bosch, the Wallenberg companies or the Indian Tata Group. The project will study enterprise foundations around the world and examine how they are governed and how they contribute to business and society.\n\nWhy\n\nThe project will be useful for enterprise foundation governance and for our understanding of corporate governance in general. It will inform the public’s understanding of the role, which enterprise foundations play as long-term owners of business companies and as charitable sponsors of science, art and social projects.\n\nHow\n\nThe project will create an international database of foundation-owned companies, which will be matched with comparable companies with other ownership structures like family business or investor ownership.  Using statistical analysis and case studies this will enable the researchers to examine the how foundation-owned companies perform financially and how they create value for society through employment, growth, corporate social responsibility and philanthropy.  The comparative corporate governance of enterprise foundations and foundation-owned will be studied by including information about board structure, minority ownership, compensation practices and other governance indicators.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project will exercise scientific social responsibility by studying whether and how enterprise foundations and long-term owners can contribute to corporate social responsibility and sustainability, for example reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (climate action), employment (decent jobs and economic growth), and responsible use of natural resources while at the same time creating economic value for shareholders. It will therefore potentially be an important contribution to stewardship in the international business community.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThe project will explore ethnic inequalities in the Danish postsecondary education system, both with regard to entry into and success within higher education. It will also study the relation between ethnicity and social origins in these inequalities and assess in how far ethnic inequalities are actually social inequalities. We attempt to break new methodological paths for inequality research by combining register data with data on the quality of written language based on natural language processing methods - i.e. automated text analysis. This will enable us to study writing skills, a core meta-competence needed in higher education, as a mechanism that potentially amplifies ethnic and social inequality and will create a unique and innovative database.\n\nWhy\n\nThe project addresses questions that are highly relevant for sociology and related disciplines that engage in inequality studies in that it contributes to the understanding of the role of higher education systems for promoting intergenerational social mobility and for integrating first- and second-generation migrants into modern societies. It aims at improving the understanding of educational decision-making and educational performance of groups that often opt against higher education or face particular challenges during their studies. The project will analyze academic writing skills as potential reason for inequality in educational performance. It will work towards methodological improvements in the use of automated text analysis for the analysis of educational inequalities.\n\nHow\n\nThe project will analyze both Danish administrative register data, e.g. from the central admission system in order to investigate inequalities in educational choices by migrant background and social origin. In addition, we will apply automated, quantitative text analysis in order to explore if minority students face particular challenges with academic writing. Combining quantitative research methods from sociology and linguistic studies, we will relate text analyses to students' pathways through higher education. In order to ensure that automated text analyses-methods will be a valid and useful tool to analyze if first generation and migrant students face particular challenges on this dimension, we will validate computer based, automated analysis by expert coding.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project aims at a sustainable contribution to the knowledge on inequalities in the education system. Explaining the reasons for inequalities according to characteristics being assigned involuntarily by birth - such as gender, ethnic background or social class - informs policy makers and other societal actors who aim at improving equal opportunities in society. Identifying obstacles to successful participation in higher education of disadvantaged youth can furthermore contribute to skill formation and hence economic growth and employment.",

We plan to examine how coherence is transferred from a laser light pulses to atomic vibrations inside materials and how this coherence and its ultimate loss to disorder result in new material properties.\n\nWhy\n\nCurrently our understanding of non-equilibrium processes in materials is very primitive, this is because our tools to look at materials on these timescales have been limited. We have developed a new range of techniques that enable us to look directly at electronic and structural dynamics on a range of length and time scales, enabling us to extract new information about how new properties emerge. By studying the roles of coherence and disorder with our new techniques, we will be able to observe why new properties emerge and why they are only transient.\n\nHow\n\nThis work will combine femtosecond laser experiments on materials performed in our laboratories at Aarhus University together with experiments at X-ray lasers in Germany, Japan and the USA. Combining an optical and X-ray approaches enables us to build complete pictures of material dynamics\n\nSSR\n\nWe rely on many different materials for specific technological needs, from energy generation, sensors and computing.

    "summary": "What\n\nBusiness research on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion -EDI- in the workplace focuses on what happens inside public and private organization, i.e. diversity management. We thus oversee a variety of actors who engage with EDI as expert suppliers such as consulting and search firms, associations and NGOs, or even business networks. It follows that we know little about the role such actors play in influencing the EDI agenda in the workplace and the type of change being achieved, in particular with regards to the balance between the business and ethical dimensions.\n\nWhy\n\nThis project breaks new ground by shifting our attention to the variety of actors that engage with EDI as expertise suppliers. Furthermore, this stretches our attention to the relations amongst these actors as well as to the relations between these actors and their client organisations - rather than focusing on the virtuousness of their common goals. The project also contributes to leveraging the use of network analysis in diversity research. The main objectives are to: 1. Theorize EDI as a moralized market and approach it empirically as a sociological field; 2. Study the positions and relationships of actors in the EDI field with social network analysis (SNA); 3. Conduct a qualitative investigation of the sensemaking and identity work of the experts conducting EDI work.\n\nHow\n\nSub-project 1: EDI as a moralized market: a neo- institutional perspective. \nCollected data will include media search, interviews with key actors (including snowball sampling), and documentation of field-defining events (social, political, legal, economical). \n\nSub-project 2: Who works with whom, and why? A social network analysis of the EDI field in Denmark. \nTo complement the data collected in sub-project 1 we will use network surveys to gather missing information from the key actors.\n\nSub-project 3: Professional activists or ethical capitalists?\nSensemaking and identity work of EDI experts. Data consists in EDI experts interviews, to understand how they make sense of the business-ethics continuum in their personal beliefs vs in what they 'sell' to firms.\n\nSSR\n\nThe project engages with the topics of Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion, which relate directly to the grand challenges as defined by the UN framework, in particular SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), and SDG 17 (partnernships for the goals). \nThe project contributes to long-term awareness and improvement of how we engage with social issues and how we try to solve them.",

    "summary": "What\n\nThis project explores how the 2015 shootings/terror attacks in Copenhagen initiated negotiations of some of the core values underpinning the Danish civil sphere, including those upholding boundaries of in/exclusion. The research will provide new insights into how the Danish civil sphere has coped with terrorism and renegotiated the boundaries of solidarity between majority and minority citizens following the attacks. It focuses on the Danish Jews' roles and experiences of these events, as this minority group has had a fundamental role in shaping and defining the ethno-religious minority space in the Danish civil sphere since the formation of the modern Danish nation state.\n\nWhy\n\nDespite the enormous national and global media coverage of the 2015 Copenhagen shootings and the immediate effects it had on Danish legislation and security polices, the events have been largely untheorized from a civil society perspective. We do not know how the attacks have affected the structure of Danish core values and how this, in turn, have influenced the civic space for Danish minority citizens. As terror aims at destabilizing social and moral order, the project contends, that is essential to study how the civil sphere responds and recuperates from such attacks and especially how minority citizens are affected in these processes.\n\nHow\n\nThis project applies a multilevel framework undergirded by participant fieldwork. I will map and analyze how Jewish differences were renegotiated and organized following the terror attack first at a discursive level, which include communicative and legislative institutions, and then at a spatial and embodied level. Informed by practice-based and affective ethnography, I will follow in the footsteps of the assemblage of \"Danish Jewish citizenship\" as it is enacted, reacted upon, communicated, legislated, and felt in and around the Synagogue of Copenhagen from 2015 to 2020.\n\nSSR\n\nTerror attacks have hit most European countries in the last few years, including Denmark. However, we still know very little about the ramifications that terror have on the civic order and how it influences cultural norms, especially related to majority-minority relations. To safeguard the pluralistic and democratic foundation of the Danish nation-state, it is thus crucial to study terrorism's effects on the civil sphere.",

    "title": "Forgiveness, Sociality, and Community: The Contributions of the Early Phenomenologists",
    "summary": "What\n\nRevising the intellectual history of forgiveness as a post-Holocaust development, I set out to show how forgiveness had already developed as a philosophical theme during the periods just before and after World War One: namely, in the writings of the early German phenomenologists. Inquiring into their discussions of forgiveness as an intersubjective and a communal phenomenon, I test the hypothesis that this development arose out of their preoccupation with the peculiarity of social acts. Moreover, I will consider how they positioned themselves in the debate about \"German guilt\" that took place during the interwar period. Further, since some of my protagonists were women, and since the ideal of forgiveness is culturally feminine, I will consider their contributions from a gender perspective.\n\nWhy\n\nDuring the post-Cold War era, a widespread societal and academic interest in forgiveness emerged. This development is considered to have stemmed from (West) German declarations of guilt and remorse; and post-Holocaust thinkers such as Hannah Arendt are regarded as pioneers in theorizing public forgiveness. It is historically significant, then, that there was in fact a rich pre-Holocaust discussion of forgiveness, guilt, and responsibility as communal phenomena. Moreover, the early phenomenologists paid close attention to issues that are underdeveloped in the current debate on public and collective forgiveness, not least regarding the sociality of forgiveness, group formation, and emotional sharing. Their discussions therefore have the potential to break new theoretical ground.\n\nHow\n\nBy considering what early phenomenological sources might add to current discussion, I take my cue from the resurrection of early phenomenology that has recently been instigated by social philosophers; yet I differ from such endeavors in paying greater attention to historical contexts. Indeed, I make the case that historical-contextual inquiry is integral to understanding and evaluating the argument and philosophical content of these sources. In investigating the potential of my historically informed interpretation for clarifying the sociality of forgiveness, I will draw on methods developed in analytic philosophy - its systematic argumentation and conceptual analysis - along with a phenomenological descriptive focus and attentiveness to experiential and affective aspects.\n\nSSR\n\nWe live in what some scholars have described as an age of forgiveness and apology, an age in which not only individuals but entire communities and political, religious, and corporate leaders ask for forgiveness. Likewise, an increasing number of reconciliation commissions are set up, not only in countries undergoing transition to democracy but also in stable democracies seeking to address historical injustice; some of the latest examples are the commissions established in the Nordic countries to address imposed Westernization of indigenous peoples. Given that the early phenomenologists engaged with questions regarding different social and communal forms of forgiveness, guilt, and responsibility, resurrecting their reflections can add to the public and academic debate on forgiveness.",

    "summary": "What\n\nMy project is about exchanging experiences around how to support children's play in Early childhood education and care (ECEC). In Victoria, Australia, the scholars I am visiting have developed a method of supporting childrens play pedagogically,and it is called \"conceptual playworld\" and they are currently evaluating this evidence based method in order to see how it works and enables children to become skilled players. We are going to analyse their data and learn from them in terms of what works well and what does not seem to work well when the aim is to support 3-6 year old childrens learning and development through play in institutional contexts. I will also inspire my Australian colleagues with regards to how we work to suppert children's play in Danish ECEC.\n\nWhy\n\nContrarily to what one might expect, it is difficult to provide rich and stimulating environments for play that all children benefit from. The adult role in stimulating play and supporting children with difficulties in becoming skilful players is complex and requires pedagogical mastery and skilful planning and methodology. Play happens, and some adults are skillful players, however if we want to build a curriculum around children's play we need to make sure that all educators are skillful players who can enable children's play also when it does not happen, and when some children are excluded and kept out of the creative circles of play in the peer-group. This requires scientifically based knowledge and solid pedagogical methods that we are going to develop in the project.\n\nHow\n\nI arrive at a good time in the project in Victoria, Australia where the research group is collecting data on the merits and pitfalls of the conceptual playworld method. We will analyse this data together and write up the findings to the scientific community. upon my return to DK I'll make use of our experiences from this project in developing and evaluation danish pedagogical pracitices around supporting childrens play in ECEC.\n\nSSR\n\nWe know that children's early learning and social life in ECEC is crucial to their well being and long-term development. Enabling all children the access to and experiences with participating in joint play with peers and adults is a beneficial way of supporting children in their general personal development. By developing solid pedagogical methods for doing so will benefit all children, both those who are skilled players already and those children who are excluded from the play.",

    "summary": "What\n\nWith the Carlsberg Monograph Fellowship I am honoured to have the opportunity to finish a monograph that I am currently researching. The monograph is a genre historical study of an important element in ancient biographies and gospels: the programmatic scene. The programmatic scene contains the main character's first public appearance, for example Alexander's first military campaign, Demosthenes' first rhetorical speech, Moses' characteristic first address to the Israelites, and Jesus' first programmatic public appearances in the gospels. In the monograph, I argue that the programmatic scene functions as a main interpretive key to the work in which the scene appears.\n\nWhy\n\nWith this monograph I offer a new approach to ancient biographies and gospels. In recent decades, scholarship has demonstrated that the New Testament gospels are Jesus biographies that play into the ancient Jewish and Greco-Roman bios/vita genre. The programmatic scene, however, remains overlooked. The monograph (1) demonstrates how the programmatic scene functioned in ancient rhetoric and literature, (2) identifies and analyses the variety of programmatic scenes in the four New Testament gospels, and (3) shows how ancient Christian gospel users in their exegetical practice and manuscript culture applied special significance to the programmatic scenes. This approach has potential for impact beyond New Testament studies, for example on the study of ancient literature in general.\n\nHow\n\nIn the monograph, I shall give particular focus to the programmatic scenes of the four New Testament gospels. Each of the four gospels highlights a different scene as the programmatic scene of Jesus. The gospel author's deliberate choice of programmatic scene thus reflects the overall theological conception and target audience of each gospel. I shall demonstrate this through in-depth exegetical analysis of the ancient Greek texts including the ancient manuscripts that reveal how later Christian readers of the gospels would interpret the programmatic scenes.\n\nSSR\n\nThe Bible is one of the great codes of Western society. The monograph illuminates the historical and contextual nature of New Testament texts. It emphasises the diversity of the Bible, a memento to fundamentalisms of today.",

We will focus on a succession of old lake deposits from the Eemian interglacial period when the global sea level was 6-9 m higher than present largely because of melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\nThe samples from Hareøen will enable us to reconstruct the local climate in West Greenland and potentially determine the climate sensitivity of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
